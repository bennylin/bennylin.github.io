<p><b>Date/Time:</b> Wed Feb 25 16:37:12 CST 2015<br>
<b>Name:</b> Richard Wordingham<br>
<b>Report Type:</b> Error Report<br>
<b>Opt Subject:</b> Indic Syllabic Categories</p>

<pre>
I've reviewed the application of the revised categories as set forth in
L2/14-126 (http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14126r-indic-properties.pdf)
as applied to the Thai, Lao and Tai Tham scripts, and noted a few other
characters, and come up with the following proposed changes of syllabic
category. I have also taken into account the proposals of Roozbeh
Pournader of 24 February 2015 related to work on the Universal Shaping
Engine.

I've come up with 3 new characters of category Bindu: 
0303 ;Bindu # Mn COMBINING TILDE 
0310 ; Bindu # Mn COMBINING CANDRABINDU
1A74 ; Bindu # Mn TAI THAM SIGN MAI KANG (currently Vowel_Dependent)

Note that both U+0ECD LAO NIGGAHITA and U+1A74 function both as Bindu
and as Vowel_Dependent. U+0303 is used in Patani Malay in the Thai
script - see UTC document L2/10-451. U+0310 is used for Sanskrit in
Tamil script, according to Indic list email 'Re: Tamil Punctuation',
27/7/12 9:24 +0530 from Shriramana Sharma.

I've found 4 new characters of category Visarga: 
0E30 ; Visarga # Lo THAI CHARACTER SARA A 
0EB0 ; Visarga # Lo LAO VOWEL SIGN A 
1A61 ; Visarga # Mc TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN A 
19B0 ; Visarga # Mc (to be Lo) NEW TAI LUE VOWEL SIGN VOWEL SHORTENER

Note that the tone (or voice modulation) character U+1038 MYANMAR SIGN
VISARGA is currently classified as Visarga. U+0E30 is used as visarga
in Sanskrit, e.g. in the Royal Institute Dictionary. The typical sound
of the four visargas above is /ʔ/ rather than /h/, and, through a
feature of Tai (SW Tai?) phonology, they all have the additional
function of shortening a vowel. As a vowel shortener, U+1A61 and U+19B0
may follow a final consonant.

These 4 characters are currently classified as Vowel_Dependent. Except
for the Lao script, that usage can easily be interpreted as a
modification of the implicit vowel. Modern Lao does not acknowledge the
existence of an implicit vowel, so that interpretation may be harder to
accept. (Vowel_Dependent U+0EB1 LAO VOWEL SIGN MAI KAN is also a vowel
shortener; in the 19th century it was denied that Vowel_Dependent
U+0E31 THAI CHARACTER MAI HAN-AKAT was a vowel in Thai.)

U+1A61 occasionally has the sound /k/, especially when used in
conjunction with U+1A62 TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN MAI SAT. I think we should
regard this as just one of the uses of visarga.

I've found 3 new nuktas, at least, so long as the application of nukta
is not restricted to *foreign* consonants. 

0331 ; Nukta # Mn COMBINING MACRON BELOW 
0359 ; Nukta # Mn COMBINING ASTERISK BELOW 
1A7F ; Nukta # Mn TAI THAM COMBINING CRYPTOGRAMMIC DOT

U+0331 is used in Patani Malay in the Thai script - see L2/10-451 and
the consonant chart on p16 of
http://mlenetwork.org/sites/default/files/Patani%20Malay%20Presentation%20-%20Part%202.pdf.  
U+0331 and U+0359 have been used in English-Thai dictionaries to
represent English sounds, very much a nukta role. They were previously
classified as 'Other', though there is a proposal to make U+1A7F
'Syllable_Modifier'. U+0EC8 LAO TONE MAI EK functions as Nukta in Khmu
as well as performing its principal rôle of Tone_Mark in Lao. U+0E3A
THAI CHARACTER PHINTHU is used both as Nukta and as Pure_Killer; the
latter is its traditional rôle.

I've found 4 new pure killers, all
currently classified as 'Other', though there is a proposal to classify
U+0E4C (along with U+17CD) as 'Consonant_Killer'.  They are: 

0E4C ;Pure_Killer # Mn THAI CHARACTER THANTHAKHAT 
0ECC ; Pure_Killer # Mn LAO CANCELLATION MARK 
1A7C ; Pure_Killer # Mn TAI THAM SIGN KHUEN-LUE KARAN
1A7A ; Pure_Killer # Mn TAI THAM SIGN RA HAAM 

U+0E4C THAI CHARACTER THANTHAKHAT and U+0E4E THAI CHARACTER YAMAKKAN
once divided the role of vowel killing - U+0E4E formed clusters and
U+0E4C removed final vowels. The use of U+0E4C came to be largely
restricted to vowels associated with clusters of consonants. Removing
the vowel made the final consonant of the cluster silent (spoken Thai
does not permit final consonant clusters), and from this effect it has
been reinterpreted as a consonant-killer. U+0ECC probably had the same
behaviour as U+0E4C. I don't know if it is still used in Laos - foreign
loanwords often don't follow the rules.

The Tai Tham marks are still at the transitional stage - they are
sometimes found on final unsubscripted consonants to indicate that they
have no vowel. There is an unfortunate overlap with the final consonant
mark for &gt;
&lt;r&gt;
 (pronunciation necessarily /n/). The Khuen and Lue from of
the final consonant symbol has the same shape as the Thai and Lao form
of the pure killer. Consequently U+1A7A serves as Consonant_Final in
Tai Khuen and Tai Lue. In Tai Khuen, at least, the use as a final
consonant seems to have recently fallen into disfavour, so it seems
most appropriate to classify U+1A7A as 'Pure_Killer'. I noted above
that the 'Pure_Killer' U+0E3A THAI CHARACTER PHINTHU also serves as a
nukta. I have a vague recollection that U+0E4C THAI CHARACTER
THANTHAKHAT serves as a register mark in an orthography for the Chong
language, so that would count as an auxiliary rôle as Tone_Mark.

If 'Consonant_Killer' is to be separated from 'Pure_Killer', then we
need a separate category 'Dual_Mode_Killer' for U+1A7A and U+1A7C.

It should be noted that U+1A62 TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN MAI SAT serves not
only as Vowel_Dependent but also as Consonant_Final. This seems to be
chiefly relevant to anyone attempting to deduce the pronunciation from
the spelling.

There are 4 characters currently categorised as 'Consonant' which I
think are better categorised as 'Vowel': 

0E24 ; Vowel # Lo THAI CHARACTER RU 
0E26 ; Vowel # Lo THAI CHARACTER LU 
1A42 ; Vowel # Lo TAI THAM LETTER RUE 
1A44 ; Vowel # Lo TAI THAM LETTER LUE

They serve both as independent and dependent vowels. Note that U+0E24 and U+0E26 may be
followed by the length mark U+0E45 THAI CHARACTER LAKKHANGYAO, which is
categorised as 'Vowel_Dependent'. I am not aware of any usage of U+0E45
as a true vowel.

The sequence &gt;
&lt;U+1AAD TAI THAM SIGN CAANG, U+1A63 TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN
AA&gt;
 occurs with the same meaning, 'elephant', as U+1AAD. I don't know
AA&gt;
 whether this justifies changing U+1AAD from 'Other' to 'Consonant_Placeholder'.

I've found one new Consonant:

0EBD ; Consonant # Lo LAO SEMIVOWEL SIGN NYO (was Consonant_Medial)
0EDE ; Consonant # Lo LAO LETTER KHMU GO (was Other)

U+0EBD is used as an initial consonant in Khmu, so U+0EBD has been used
in all rôles in the Lao script, like U+0EA7 LAO LETTER WO, which is of
category Consonant. For information on Khmu usage, see UTC document
L2/10-335 (http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2010/10335r-n3893r-lao-hosken.pdf). The
Khmu alphabet chart included backs up the text. (It also shows U+0EC8
LAO TONE MAI EK acting as a Nukta!)

If 'repha' can be used as a general category, including for example
Myanmar script kinzi, then there are two arguable new examples,
currently categorised as Consonant_Final:

1A58 ; Consonant_Preceding_Repha? # Mn TAI THAM SIGN MAI KANG LAI
1A5A ; Consonant_Succeeding_Repha? # Mn TAI THAM CONSONANT SIGN LOW PA

There are significant issues with U+1A58; while traditionally it
behaves as repha/kinzi, some modern styles are better served by
treating it as Consonant_Final. It takes some juggling for a single
OTL-style rendering engine to be able to render either style depending
on the lookups while oblivious to the difference, but it can be done.

I've found 5 new instances of Consonant_Subjoined: 
1A57 ; Consonant_Subjoined # Mc TAI THAM CONSONANT SIGN LA TANG LAI 
1A5B ; Consonant_Subjoined # Mn TAI THAM CONSONANT SIGN HIGH RATHA OR
LOW PA
1A5C ; Consonant_Subjoined # Mn TAI THAM CONSONANT SIGN MA 
1A5D ; Consonant_Subjoined # Mn TAI THAM TAI THAM CONSONANT SIGN BA 
1A5E ; Consonant_Subjoined # Mn TAI THAM CONSONANT SIGN SA

They were all previously categorised as Consonant_Final.

Note that U+1A57 is an abbreviation. It is derived by the addition of a
stroke to the subscript form &gt;
&lt;U+1A60 TAI THAM SIGN SAKOT, U+1A43 TAI
THAM LETTER LA&gt;
. Abbreviations of the word _tanglaai_ 'all' using U+1A57
normally include at least &gt;
&lt;U+1A57, U+1A63 TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN AA&gt;
, so
U+1A57 is not Consonant_Final.  An example, apparently spelt &gt;
&lt;U+1A26
TAI THAM LETTER NGA, U+1A57, U+1A76 TAI THAM SIGN TONE-2, U+1A63 TAI
THAM VOWEL SIGN AA&gt;
, is given in Table 16 at
http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tai/TaiLue/graphic%20blends.htm.

The word ᨶᩥᨻᩛᩤᨶ &gt;
&lt;U+1A36 TAI THAM LETTER NA, 1A65 TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN I, 1A3B
TAI THAM LETTER LOW PA, 1A5B, 1A64 TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN TALL AA, 1A36&gt;

_nippa:na_ 'nirvana' immediately demonstrates that U+1A5B is not a
final consonant. U+1A5C occurs in Pali proper names ending -mmo &gt;
&lt;U+1A3E
TAI THAM LETTER MA, U+1A5C, U+1A6E TAI THAM VOWEL SIGN E, U+1A63 TAI
THAM VOWEL SIGN AA&gt;
, so is clearly not a final consonant.

U+1A5D occurs in Northern Thai principally in one word, whose
pronunciation is roughly /kɔbɔː/.  U+1A5D is not Consonant_Final in its
phonetic effect. The word is a compound word (or perhaps just a visual
compound), formed by chaining two syllables and striking out
the duplicated characters. I have a text in which the constituents are
to be encoded &gt;
&lt;U+1A20 TAI THAM LETTER HIGH KA, U+1A74 TAI THAM SIGN MAI
KANG&gt;
 and &gt;
&lt;U+1A37 TAI THAM LETTER BA, U+1A74, U+1A75 TAI THAM SIGN
KANG&gt;
 TONE-1&gt;
, so the chained word may reasonably be encoded &gt;
&lt;U+1A20,
KANG&gt;
 U+1A74, U+1A5D, U+1A75&gt;
 or &gt;
&lt;U+1A20, U+1A5D, U+1A74, U+1A75&gt;
.

While all my examples of U+1A5E are word final, it seems to differ from
&gt;
&lt;U+1A60, U+1A48 TAI THAM LETTER HIGH SA&gt;
 on the basis of the room
available for it. Both forms are used as a word final consonant. The
only Pali consonant cluster ending in /s/ is /ss/, and that is written
using U+1A54 TAI THAM LETTER GREAT SA, so a non-final &gt;
&lt;s&gt;
 will be rare.
(I'm finding /ks/ written with U+1A47 TAI THAM LETTER HIGH SSA due to
the application of RUKI.) However, I feel it would be rash to presume
that every example of U+1A5E will be a final consonant.

I have one new Consonant_Final:

0EDF ; Consonant_Final # Lo LAO LETTER KHMU NYO (was Consonant)

See UTC document L2/10-335 for evidence.

I have one possible new Consonant_subjoined:

1A7B ; Consonant_subjoined # Mn TAI THAM SIGN MAI SAM 

The value of its Indic_Matra_Category, if relevant, should be recorded
as Top. U+1A7B is principally a repetition mark, indicating the
repetition of a word.  As extensions of this role, it can also do at
least the following:

(1) Indicate a repeated (not geminate) consonant
(2) Indicate an omitted implicit vowel (one omits an implicit vowel by
replacing it with U+1A60)
(3) Indicate an epenthetic vowel (extension
of Role 2).

In rôle (1), it serves as a subjoined consonant.  In rôles
(2) and (3), it serves as a dependent vowel.  For a shaper that does
not constrain appearance, such as the Universal Shaping Engine, the
best categorisation  is probably 'Consonant_subjoined'.

Although U+1A55 TAI THAM CONSONANT SIGN MEDIAL RA and U+1A56 TAI THAM
CONSONANT SIGN MEDIAL LA are named as medial consonants, too much
should not be read into such a description.  Both are, very
occasionally, immediately preceded by vowels, and both may be followed
by &gt;
&lt;U+1A60 TAI THAM SIGN SAKOT,  U+1A40 TAI THAM LETTER HIGH YA&gt;
 and
&gt;
&lt;U+1A60, U+1A45 TAI THAM LETTER WA&gt;
.  While the latter two sequences
most commonly represent vowels, the strictly consonantal cluster
&gt;
&lt;U+1A49 TAI THAM LETTER HIGH HA, U+1A56, U+1A60, U+1A45&gt;
 starts a few
words beginning with the cluster /lw/.  This is a behaviour the
Universal Shaping Engine of Microsoft currently disallows for medial
consonants.

We should therefore have: 
1A55 ; Consonant_Subjoined #Mc       TAI THAM CONSONANT SIGN MEDIAL RA 
1A56 ; Consonant_Subjoined #Mn       TAI THAM CONSONANT SIGN MEDIAL LA

I actually see no benefits for rendering engines in distinguishing Consonant_Medial and
Consonant_Subjoined, though the contrast may help in locating phonetic syllable boundaries.

While the current candiadates for category Consonant_Succeeding_Repha may
descend from repha, only one of them, U+17CC KHMER SIGN ROBAT is clearly still
a repha.

Reading the script descriptions in TUS makes it abundantly clear that U+1B03

consonants.  The TUS also states that U+1B81 SUNDANESE SIGN PANGLAYAR is a

Indic Syllabic and Positional Category of U+A9BD JAVANESE CONSONANT SIGN KERET

In Indic Syllabic Category data, U+A9BD JAVANESE CONSONANT SIGN KERET is
categorized as 'Consonant_Subjoined'. This is incorrect. U+A9BD is not a
subjoined form of any Javanese consonant. Historically, U+A9BD is a dependent
vowel of vocalic r. Its counterpart in Balinese script is U+1B3A BALINESE
VOWEL SIGN RA REPA; and U+1B3A is categorized as 'Vowel_Dependent'. In modern
Javanese, U+A9BD is used as replacement for U+A9BF JAVANESE CONSONANT SIGN
CAKRA (medial ra) if followed by U+A9BC JAVANESE VOWEL SIGN PEPET (vowel sign
ĕ). So in modern Javanese U+A9BD is treated like a medial consonant sign. In
books teaching about Javanese script, the three characters are always grouped
together: medial ya (U+A9BE JAVANESE CONSONANT SIGN PENGKAL), medial ra
(U+A9BF JAVANESE CONSONANT SIGN CAKRA), and medial rĕ (U+A9BD JAVANESE
CONSONANT SIGN KERET). So U+A9BD in Indic Syllabic Category should be
recategorized as 'Consonant_Medial' like U+A9BE and U+A9BF. However, unlike
U+A9BE and U+A9BF, U+A9BD can't be followed by vowel signs because it already
have inherent ĕ vowel.

Also the Unicode Character Categories of this U+A9BD character is incorrect.
It should not be categorized as 'Mc' (Mark, Spacing Combining), but 'Mn'
(Mark, Nonspacing). This character is nonspacing and its behavior in combining
with other character and forming ligature is similar to nonspacing vowel sign
u (U+A9B8) and uu (U+A9B9). Its Balinese counterpart U+1B3A also has 'Mn'
character category. So the Indic Positional Category of this character should
also be corrected from 'Right' to 'Bottom'.

JAVANESE CONSONANT SIGN CAKRA

The positional category of U+A9BE JAVANESE CONSONANT SIGN PENGKAL should be
corrected from 'Right' to 'Bottom_And_Right'.

The positional category of U+A9BF JAVANESE CONSONANT SIGN CAKRA should be
corrected from 'Right' to 'Bottom_And_Left'; but I can't find this category in
the Indic Positional Category data. This character is similar to U+103C
MYANMAR CONSONANT SIGN MEDIAL RA. U+103C is not found/categorized in the Indic
Positional Category data.

Indic Syllabic Category of U+1B03, U+1B81, and U+A982

I agree with Mr. Richard Wordingham's feedback. U+1B03 BALINESE SIGN SURANG,
U+1B81 SUNDANESE SIGN PANGLAYAR, and U+A982 SIGN LAYAR all were historically
repha; but in modern writings, these characters are final -r consonant sign.

Because Balinese, Sundanese, and Javanese characters are encoded with logical
order, I think categorized these characters for visually ordered repha is
wrong. For consistency with other Indic scripts that only use repha in older
texts (such as Telugu), old repha in Balinese, Sundanese, and Javanese should
also be encoded with RA + VIRAMA + ZWJ.

<b>Opt Subject:</b> Ambiguity in Chapter 12.1 Devanagari, section Encoding Principles</p>

<pre>
The section says (http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch12.pdf):

"The orthographic syllable is built up of alphabetic pieces, the actual letters
of the Devanagari script. These pieces consist of three distinct character
types: consonant letters, independent vowels, and dependent vowel signs. In a
text sequence, these characters are stored in logical (phonetic) order.
Consonant letters by themselves constitute a CV unit, where the V is an
inherent vowel, whose exact phonetic value may vary by writing system.
Independent vowels also constitute a CV unit, where the C is considered to be
null.

A dependent vowel sign is used to represent a V in CV units where V is not the
inherent vowel."

To be clear, the last sentence should read: 

A dependent vowel sign is used to represent a V in CV units where V is not the
inherent vowel **and C is not null**.

Because otherwise, it's confusing to say in one sentence that an independent
vowel is a CV unit, and in the next sentence say that in CV units a dependent
vowel sign is used. Obviously, in independent vowels (which are CV units) no
dependent vowel sign is used.

Feedback from native Chinese colleagues indicates that if they recognize

If they do not recognize it, they guess "sǎn" based on the more common 散.

If I understand correctly, this means that kMandarin=sǎn is incorrect.

<b>Opt Subject:</b> Cheese and Bacon Emojis</p>

<pre>
Dear Unicode Consortium,

First off, I'd like to congratulate you on the release of Unicode 7.0. I love
the diverse skin tones available for characters and hand signals, as well as
the variety of new characters that were added.

I noticed that 'Cheese Wedge' is a proposed Emoji for the Unicode 8.0 update,
and I could not be more excited. I have, on several occasions, wished that
there was a cheese-related Emoji available. I would like to strongly advocate
for its inclusion, and thank you for your consideration of the community's
suggestions for characters.

I was disappointed, however, to see that a 'Bacon' Emoji was not slated for
the 8.0 update. While I understand that Unicode is universal and bacon is not
necessarily ubiquitous across cultures, bacon has become a trend in the
culture of the western world. Bacon is rising in popularity in fast food items
as well as high-end dining, and its popularity extends beyond cuisine. There
are bacon-themed clothes, bacon-scented toiletries, and bacon-related
housewares that are quite popular (although I can't say they're quite my
taste). It seems fitting that Emojis, which are also becoming a hot cultural
trend, would include a bacon unicode character.

The inclusion of 'Cheese Wedge' and 'Bacon' unicode characters in the 8.0
update would make me absolutely ecstatic. If there is a specific party or
group I should contact with these suggestions, please let me know. And if you
would like suggestions or examples of art work, I would be happy to contribute
those with no expectations of credit.

Thank you very much for your kind consideration, and I look forward to hearing
from you soon.

Sincerely,
Nick Lawson

<b>Opt Subject:</b> Confusion about meaning of White_Space property</p>

<pre>
There is confusion in the standard and the FAQ about the meaning of the
White_Space property. As I read the standard, the only official definition is
given in UAX #44:

"White_Space: [...] Spaces, separator characters and other control characters 
which should be treated by programming languages as "white space" for the 
purpose of parsing elements."

Basically, no relation to display.

But the Core Spec, in page 250, says:

"Line separation characters, such as the carriage return, do not clearly
exhibit their advance width, because they always occur at the end of a line,
but most implementations give them a visible advance width when they are
selected. Hence, they are classed together with space characters; both are
given the White_Space property. Whitespace characters are not considered to
be ignored for display."

This is contradicting the definition in UAX #44, where it says the property is
not about displaying things, but parsing things.

The FAQ also confuses the property's meaning. At
http://unicode.org/faq/unsup_char.html#2, it says:

Q: Which characters should be displayed as a visible but blank space?

A: This is the easy one: all the characters that have the White_Space
property, also generically known as “whitespace characters”. This set includes
SPACE, of course, but also such characters as the tab control character, NO-
BREAK SPACE, LINE SEPARATOR, and so on. For the full list, see the White_Space
values in PropList.txt.

<p style="color: #FF3333"><b>Note: This has been fixed in the master data file.</b></p>
<pre>
Hello,

in the beta code chart of UC 8.0, there is a note below character AB60, that
points to A657 "Cyrillic small letter iotified a" as the source for this
letter. This is not correct. The new letter AB60 is simply a glyph variant of
0463, Cyrillic Small letter yat. (And indeed, the code chart for 8.0 has the
correct back-reference to AB60 at 0463.)

Because AB60 and 0463 do look completely diffent, one bit of background might
help: the glyph at AB60 is simply the *upright* variant of a glyph variation
more commonly found for the *cursive* form of 0463. Even some of today's fonts
have that glyph variation which in its cursive form looks like a Latin cursive
"n" with a cyrillic soft sign tacked onto is right side.

Sebastian Kempgen

Bidi-mirroring of mathematical symbols

Hi

I would like to send you my previous suggestion with my new email address, to
replace the former post, which is poorly written too, I'm sorry.

There may be a problem with bidi-mirroring of mathematical symbols. U+2260 and
U+2262 are bidi-mirrored, U+226D is not.  So probably U+226D should be.

But it seems implementers don’t care about bidi-mirroring of mathematical
symbols, except common ones, as U+003C and U+003E.  When these are negated,
U+226E and U+226F, there is no more bidi-mirroring in Windows NotePad.  This
may be why U+226D is not bidi-mirrored in Unicode.  But it seems inconsistent.

Consistently with U+2215 / U+29F5, bidi-mirroring of U+2260 and U+2262 means a
backslash for negation when script is right-to-left.  Making it a rule,
mathematical slashes, even U+2298, convert to backslashes when bidi-mirrored
(I hope I’m right).

More generally, there is a need to inform the readers of the Code Charts which
characters are bidi-mirrored and which ones are not.  For that purpose, bidi-
mirroring should be indicated  systematically.  This is as important as casing
and glyph shape informations.  Given the amount of information made available
in the Code Charts and NamesList, bidi-mirroring should not be confined to an
implementation issue and therefore, the bidi-mirroring information  should be
available inside the Code Charts, not only in UnicodeData.txt and additional
files.

Because NamesList translators are free to add comments, I’m adding bidi-
mirroring comment lines at each character or subhead that is concerned with
this issue.  This is properly a French NamesList  translation issue.

Not showing bidi-mirroring in the Code Charts, might be interpreted as missing
respectfulness against right-to-left scripts, therefore right-to-left script
users may be worried about.  Bidi-mirroring is so important it should not be
searched for in UnicodeData.txt, BidiBrackets.txt and BidiMirroring.txt, but
shown straight in the Code Charts.

Best regards,
Marcel Schneider

Notice line vs Comment line

Hi,

there are “idle” “@+” in the NamesList, which in the Code Charts draft have no
effect on markup or highlighting in any way, but disturbed the results of a
sorting (spreadsheet) formula with the NamesList. (In fact, I used the French
translation, where many idle “@+” are missing, and added them following the
NamesList-8.0.0d6.)

There seems to be no difference between such a NOTICE_LINE with bullet
applying to a character, and a COMMENT_LINE. Therefore, I suggest to convert
these NOTICE_LINEs to COMMENT_LINEs.

The list below shows the instances in the NamesList where “idle @+” occurs:
U+0140
U+0149
U+01A6
U+0268
U+0269
U+0277

Code points with bookmarks in the All-in-one Code Charts PDF

Hello,

I would suggest adding the first code point before the Blockheads that display
in the side pane on Adobe Reader when viewing the All Code Charts PDF. The
Blockheads are very useful, but often a given code point must be searched for.
Then showing the Start point together with the Blockhead will help finding
glyphs quickly.

It would also be useful, instead, to show the startpoints parenthesized after
the Blockheads, if the goal is to avoid puzzling users with figures.  This
will be the reason why actually the code point searching readers can click at
an estimated (or learned) position and then control the range looking at the
page header.

Using the single code charts instead, presents some disadvantages:

— Most archive managing software cannot sort on hex values, so the code 
charts in a folder are unordered.

— For convenience, there is neither endpoint nor blockhead in the single 
charts filenames (they are opened with code point searching software).

Best regards,
Marcel Schneider

Head numbering in the Standard, refs to the Standard in the Code Charts

Hi,

it is sometimes hard to quote and to retrieve an instance in the Standard
because there are only two numbering levels: chapters and sections. For
example, the long section 6.2 is structured with many unnumbered heads.

Therefore I suggest adding a third numbering level. With these additional
numbers, quoting would be facilitated, and when they appear in the navigation
pane, retrieving would be too.

Numbering levels have been restricted to two in order to avoid puzzling with
too much figures. IMO the more the Standard is quoted, the more it will become
popular and well-known. This is why I suggest that comments in the Code Charts
should point to the Standard where appropriate, showing “§9.9.9” refs, for
example at U+0029:

“* see discussion on semantics of paired bracketing characters”
might become:
“* see discussion on semantics of paired bracketing characters, chapter 6 of the Standard, section 2.10”
or just:
“* see discussion on semantics of paired bracketing characters, §6.2.10”.

As well, bidi-mirroring may be referred to as “bidi-mirrored (see §4.7)” at a
significant number of instances in the Code Charts (and the NamesList).

UAXes, other UTNs and UTRs might be quoted too, where this would be helpful to
get started with Unicode.

Marcel Schneider

Bidi-mirrored Code Charts

Hi,

given that bidi-mirroring of symbols is a very complex issue (see U+2260 and
U+2262 as well as U+2298 that are bidi-mirrored, vs U+226D and U+2205 that are
actually not), it might be useful to have bidi-mirrored Code Charts.  They
would facilitate the implementation of Unicode for right-to-left scripts.

Today, users who aim at getting started with Unicode, must guess what bidi-
mirrored symbols look like whenever there is no Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph for a
ready-to-use bidi-mirroring emulation.  Therefore I suggest adding bidi-
mirrored Code Charts where appropriate.  Every block’s charts that contain
bidi-mirrored characters would be followed by a set of Code Charts where these
characters are bidi-mirrored and highlighted in some way, perhaps with the
abbreviation “BM” in the upper left corner.

Best regards.

A new extended datafile to speed up implementation

Hi,

since many data came to join up UnicodeData for a complete character property
repertoire, it might be helpful to create a new overall datafile on the
pattern of UnicodeData, including more fields such as FormalAlias,
BidiMirrored, and some spare fields, in order to enhance transparency and
promote more complete implementations than are often seen even today.

The question that is to be asked, is whether the hints Unicode gives
implementers are well understood. For example, Unicode deprecates parsing the
NamesList for machine-readable information, and nevertheless it is the
NamesList that is parsed for example by keyboard creating software, while
often no notice is taken of the FormalAliases.

I take notice of the policy of adding new files rather than new fields to
UnicodeData. But perhaps it would be now time to add a new comprehensive base
file, including much of the information of NamesList and all the other files
of UCD.

Best regards.

Chapter 6 of the Standard

Hi,

I would like to suggest adding some information to the second paragraph of the
“Apostrophes” subsection in section 6.2 “General Punctuation” of the Standard,
on page 272.

The paragraph is pasted below, and the suggested information is added within,
highlighted with underscores.

The first statement is based on 87 klc sources of latin keyboard layouts
shipped with Windows 7 Starter. The docx is attached below. Please note the
Canadian multilingual standard keyboard layout klc source is uncomplete
because Kana is not recognized by the software. It adds as eleventh keyboard
with U+2019 among a total of 87 keyboards, making the exact percentage end up
at 87% locale latin Windows keyboards without U+2019. Even while the US
Standard keyboard layout does not contain U+2019, the US International
keyboard layout, however, does, along with U+2018.

The second statement resumes an article found with a search engine at the
following URL: http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113101/smart-quotes-are-
killing-apostrophe

The third statement results from observation using a small panel of free
ornamental fonts, most handwriting.

Best regards.
P.S.: I will send the docx by mail after this form
__________________________
When text is set, U+2019 right single quotation mark is preferred as
apostrophe, but _it is missing on about 90% of most current locale latin
keyboards, where_ only U+0027 is present__. Software commonly offers a
facility for automatically converting the U+0027 apostrophe to a contextually
selected curly quotation glyph. _This facility uses to fail when U+0027
represents a leading apostrophe, not an opening quotation mark._ In these
systems, a U+0027 in the data stream is always represented as a straight
vertical line and can never represent a curly apostrophe or a right quotation
mark. _However, many ornamental fonts associate the same curly glyph to U+0027
as to U+2019._

Chapter 6 of the Standard

Hi,

there is some additional information about U+2044 FRACTION SLASH I would
suggest adding at the “Fraction Slash” paragraphs in the “Other Punctuation”
subsection of §6.2, page 273 of the Standard, as well as in the Code Charts’
Fractions subheader before U+2150.

U+2044 FRACTION SLASH working together with superscripts and subscripts is so
obvious no discussion is needed. On the other hand, as fraction formatting
needs at least desktop publishing software, it is usually not a part of office
automation. It seems therefore useful to show the plain text entering method
for fractions with a slanted fraction slash like the default glyph of U+2044.

The Number Forms block’s Fractions subhead may therefore be followed by a
NOTICE_LINE like this one: ‘@+’ [TAB] [TAB] ‘Fractions may be composed in
plain text on a [superscripts] 2044 [subscripts] pattern.’

Meanwhile, the Fraction Slash notice in the Standard might contain the informations 
below (including those already provided in the Standard).

Best regards.

___________________________
Fraction Slash. U+2044 FRACTION SLASH is used between digits to form numeric
fractions. It is kerning for use with superscripts and subscripts to compose
plain text fractions such as ²⁄₃ and ³⁄₉.The pattern of a plain text fraction
built using the fraction slash is defined as follows: any sequence of one or
more superscript digits (U+00B9, U+00B2, U+00B3, U+2074 - U+2079, U+2070),
followed by the fraction slash, followed by any sequence of one or more
subscript digits (U+2080 - U+2089).

U+2044 FRACTION SLASH may also act as a formatting command for use with
decimal digits, and it may be used instead of U+002F SOLIDUS prior to applying
fraction formatting. The standard form of a fraction designed for formatting
is defined as follows: any sequence of one or more decimal digits (General
Category = Nd), followed by the fraction slash, followed by any sequence of
one or more decimal digits. If the fraction is to be separated from a previous
number, then a space can be used, choosing the appropriate width (normal,
thin, zero width, and so on). For example, 1 + thin space + 3 + fraction slash
+ 4 can be displayed as 1¾.

Whether they are plain text or formatted, fractions should be displayed as a
unit, such as ¾ or {unavailable glyph}. The precise choice of display can
depend on additional formatting information. If the displaying software is
incapable of mapping the fraction to a unit, then it can also be displayed as
a simple linear sequence as a fallback (for example, 3/4). For fallback
display, U+002F SOLIDUS is preferred, because the fraction slash kerns.

Chapter 6 of the Standard

Hello,

in section 6.2, on page 268 of the Standard, Quotation Marks and Brackets, I

first paragraph. The result would look as quoted below, where the move is
highlighted with underscores.

Best regards.

‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

Quotation Marks and Brackets. Like brackets, quotation marks occur in pairs,
with some overlap in usage and semantics between these two types of
punctuation marks. For example, some of the CJK quotation marks resemble
brackets in appearance, and they are often used when brackets would be used in
non-CJK text. Similarly, both single and double guillemets may be treated more
like brackets than quotation marks. __Unlike brackets, quotation marks are not
mirrored in a bidirectional context.__

Some of the editing marks used in annotated editions of scholarly texts
exhibit features of both quotation marks and brackets. The particular
convention employed by the editors determines whether editing marks are used
in pairs, which editing marks form a pair, and which is the opening
character.____

Chapter 6 of the Standard

Hello,

in section 6.2, on page 268, Language-Based Usage of Quotation Marks, it may
be possible to add some useful content to the two first paragraphs. They are
quoted below (the second is split), and changes are highlighted with
underscores.

The first modification is needed to support the fact that U+0022 is optionally
converted to chevrons (guillemets).

The meaning of the “warning” quotation marks is to prevent the reader from
taking the expression in plain sense. Following French usage they may be
called “irony quotes”, but often there is no irony at all, just the meaning of
“so-called”.

Best regards.

‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Language-Based Usage of Quotation Marks 

U+0022 QUOTATION MARK is the most commonly used character for quotation mark.
However, it has ambiguous semantics and direction. Most keyboard layouts
support only U+0022 QUOTATION MARK, but software commonly offers a facility
for automatically converting the U+0022 QUOTATION MARK to a contextually
selected _quotation mark_ glyph.

European Usage. The use of quotation marks differs systematically by language
and by medium. In European typography, it is common to use _angle quotation
marks (guillemets, chevrons) in publishing_ and, except for some languages,
curly quotation marks in office automation. Single guillemets may be used _to
clarify the presence of nested quotations_. _Many authors use angle and curly
quotation marks in the same text to distinguish between quoting and warning._

The following description does not attempt to be complete, but intends to
document a range of known usages of quotation mark characters. Some of these
usages are also illustrated in Figure 6-3. In this section, the words single
and double are omitted from character names where there is no conflict or both
are meant.

NamesList, U+0022 and U+0027

Hello,

in the NamesList and the Code Charts, at U+0022, the COMMENT_LINE “* neutral
(vertical), used as opening or closing quotation mark” should be replaced with
its counterpart at U+0027: “* neutral (vertical) glyph with mixed usage”,
because U+0022 is also used for “seconds”, “double prime” and “ditto”.

Furthermore, it is doubtful whether locale language-specific support is
appropriate here. Therefore, I suggest replacing “* preferred characters in
English for paired quotation marks are 201C &amp; 201D”, because on one side, this
is true for other languages (e.g. French), and on the other side, there are
ways to support far more languages here, with something like “* some preferred
characters for paired double quotation marks are found at 201C-201E”. The next
step would eventually be to remove “* 05F4 is preferred for gershayim when
writing Hebrew”, and to rely on the CROSS_REF “x (hebrew punctuation gershayim
- 05F4)”. I've learned some Hebrew and I like it very much, also the Jewish
nation, of course, but I fear this COMMENT_LINE brings some risk of conflict.
IMO Hebrew language support is ensured thanks to the already provided CROSS_REF “x
(hebrew punctuation gershayim - 05F4)”.

If the above statements are right, they would identically apply to U+0027,
third and fourth COMMENT_LINE. In any case, as shown in UTN #24, an English
translation is needed (the English don’t call a slash a SOLIDUS, while they
call a FULL-STOP a period, too). In this English translation (ideally for use
in both the United States and the United Kingdom and all English speaking or
using countries), the COMMENT_LINE “* preferred characters in English for
paired quotation marks are 201C &amp; 201D” will be really appropriate.

Chapter 6 of the Standard

Hi,

in section 6.2, in the subsection “Dashes and Hyphens” on page 265, I suggest
to enhance the information about U+2010 HYPHEN. In most fonts where it is
present, it does not differ in appearance from U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS. Hence, in
many fonts, whether current or ornamental, it is missing. There is at least
one good font where the statements in the Standard apply, because U+002D is
rendered with a tiny wide glyph that is not convenient as a hyphen.

Therefore, entering U+2010 as default hyphen in raw text does not seem to be
appropriate. When it is preferred in a given layout, a routine can put it at
the place of U+002D, the minus sign U+2212 MINUS SIGN being entered
expressedly to disambiguate the two semantic values of hyphenation and minus.

In practice, U+2010 seems to be seldom used. Even in the Standard, typesetted
in Minion-Regular, the hyphen character is U+002D, as found in the sample
“left-to-right” in this paragraph. I’ve tried to put U+2010 on the keyboard as
default hyphen in typesetting mode, but the problems lead me to reset the
character to U+002D. I make U+2010 available in the dead key registry (acute,
hyphen), mainly to facilitate the search-and-replace settings.

As a result, the sentence “It is rendered with a narrow width.” should be
completed in some way, because in nearly all fonts, U+002D is rendered with a
narrow width too. (I would not mention MS Gothic where U+2010 displays with an
extra space around!)

Best regards.

NamesList and the Code Charts

Hi,

there seems to be a mistake with character names. In fact they are
designations, and they are handled a such. The goal of a character’s name is
to give an accurate idea of what the character is, and to facilitate referring
to in natural language. As an immutable identifier there is the code point.
Systems handle code points, not character names. Software does not need any
other identifier.

This is why freezing character names is an abuse, especially when they proved
to be wrong. There is a very strong desire to design most accurate names,
which lead to passionate discussions at the merger of ISO/IEC 10646 with
Unicode. But the renaming of U+00C6/U+00E6 to its original letter status
produced surprisingly a name-update prohibition act, a Stability Policy that
extends over names instead of ensuring code point stability only. Suddenly,
character names were called by ISO “convenient identifiers”, not more. And not
less.

Fortunately Unicode found a workaround, giving characters that are completely
misnamed, a Formal Alias, thanks to which Formal Alias aware software is able
to display a true designation in most cases. Unfortunately, the remedy is not
applied to characters such as U+002F SOLIDUS, a slash that bears the scholar
name of the fraction slash (U+2044 FRACTION SLASH may be called with some
reason a solidus). And even more unfortunately, there would be fare too many
Formal Aliases if all the abusive lateralization of bidi-mirrored paired
punctuations would be corrected. Even out of bidirectional context, the “LEFT”
qualifier is unfitting for U+2018 and U+201C in a Universal Character Set.

UnicodeData shows clearly where most of the awkward names are from. Or, more
accurately, where they are NOT from. By misnaming characters in an
ethnocentric way, ISO acted against its mission as an international standards
body. It is obvious an international organization for standardization must
respect its members’ wishes. And when one of the countries complains about
misnaming, it must correct and apologize, not rage and protest. Nor prohibit
further updates.

Therefore I suggest doing some general overhaul. Beginning with the Stability
Policy.

As to avoid lateralization where it is undue, LEFT and RIGHT may be replaced
with the original OPENING and CLOSING where it is unambiguous, or with
BACKWARD-POINTING and FORWARD-POINTING.

Best regards.

U+00D0, U+00F0 LATIN SMALL LETTER ETH; U+0110, U+0111 LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH STROKE

As in this block, uppercase and lowercase are at 32 code points from each
other, there would normally be no need of mentioning. The Icelandic LATIN
LETTER ETH may differ from the rule because of the risk of confusing it with
U+0110/U+0111 LATIN LETTER D WITH STROKE (which lead early standards bodies to
encode the capital once only!). But ordinarily the NamesList uses
COMMENT_LINEs, not CROSS_REFs, for casing information. Therefore I suggest
replacing

	x (latin small letter eth - 00F0)
and	x (latin capital letter eth - 00D0)
with  	* lowercase is 00F0
and 	* uppercase is 00D0

The same would then apply to the LATIN LETTER D WITH STROKE, because as in
this block, lowercase follows uppercase, it was only the risk of confusion
with U+00D0/U+00F0 that lead Unicode to add the CROSS_REFs

	x (latin small letter d with stroke - 0111)
and	x (latin capital letter d with stroke - 0110)
However, as shown above,
	* lowercase is 0111)
and	* uppercase is 0110

COMMENT_LINEs seem to fit better this particular context. Even if at this
instance, they would only ensure all concerned languages are treated equally.

NamesList and the Code Charts

If there is no way of reengineering character names stability, that is, if the
convenience of the relatively little number of involved specialists primes
over the billions of end-users who will stay a long time dealing with code
names while nearly no translations are provided, then I suggest making an
extensive use of the correcting facility Unicode created with FormalAliases.

To perform this, at least all characters that are bidi-mirrorred and whose
names are ethnocentric, should be provided a FormalAlias. For example: U+00AB
LEFT DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK, which Unicode first named LEFT POINTING
GUILLEMET, may be given the FormalAlias % BACKWARD-POINTING GUILLEMET or
BACKWARD-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK. U+00BB RIGHT DOUBLE ANGLE
QUOTATION MARK, which Unicode first named RIGHT POINTING GUILLEMET, may be
given the FormalAlias % FORWARD-POINTING GUILLEMET or FORWARD-POINTING DOUBLE
ANGLE QUOTATION MARK.

A warning should be placed in the file header, to point out that all character
names that are followed by a FormalAlias, should be discarded at use, and the
FormalAlias is strongly recommended to be used instead.


The next question is whether it would not be sufficient, if there is a Formal
Alias, to show the code name on a CODENAME_LINE. This would allow to shift the
Formal Aliases on the NAME_LINE. Subsequently, the (relatively) few
specialists who are dealing with standardization may be asked to refer always
to the CodeName wherever there is one.

Even simplier, the roles of CharacterName and FormalAlias may be inverted at
these instances, giving the Formal Alias a Code Name status (and the Character
Name a True Designation status). Then it would be enough to disable the
FormalAlias-awareness-algorithms (which do most likely not even exist already
in end-user software, at least not in some relatively widespread free keyboard
layout creating software for end-users).

Marcel Schneider

U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS

As the ALIAS_LINE of this character collapses nearly with its COMMENT_LINE, it
would be nice to ventilate the aliases on several lines as it is found at
U+223C TILDE OPERATOR, in order to separate the two very different semantic
values. Instead of a “hyphen or minus sign” alias, there would be two, like:

	= hyphen
	= minus sign

Furthermore, after the COMMENT_LINE

	* used for either hyphen or minus sign

it will be useful to add another one, because U+002D does not match neither
figures nor the other operators as U+002B PLUS SIGN, so using it as a minus
sign is very bad typography. This COMMENT_LINE might show the following
information:

	* 2212 is preferred for minus sign

It follows the one existing already for U+0027 APOSTROPHE (“* 2019 is
preferred for apostrophe”). Indeed, IMO the two cases are roughly similar.

Numeric Separators

In the Standard, §6.2, page 275, a brief mention of Numeric Separators is
found. It consists merely in an enumeration of five characters or code points
and refers to the existence of locale and user customizations. While one of
them is the ARABIC THOUSANDS SEPARATOR U+066C, no mention is made in the ASCII
block of such a semantic value for period or comma. Nevertheless, the French
translation adds “thousands separator” among the aliases of U+002E FULL STOP.

IMO the related semantic values are so important these characters should be
shifted into the subset of well commented characters in the Code Charts, and
the related subject might become more extensively covered in the Standard.
Therefore adding some information might be useful, perhaps as suggested below.

Best regards,
Marcel Schneider


1) In the NamesList:

0027	APOSTROPHE
Add a third ALIAS_LINE:
	= prime, minutes, feet, thousands separator
Among the CROSS_REFs: add
	x (arabic thousands separator - 066C)

002C	COMMA
On the ALIAS_LINE: add “thousands separator” after “= decimal separator”.
Among the CROSS_REFs: add 
	x (arabic decimal separator - 066B)

002E	FULL STOP
Split the ALIAS_LINE and add “thousands separator” after “= decimal point”, like this:
	= period, dot
	= decimal point, thousands separator
Add a COMMENT_LINE as this:
	* used as a thousands separator when 002C is decimal separator, and conversely
and place it first.

2019	RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
Add a second COMMENT_LINE:
	* may be used as a thousands separator
Among the CROSS_REFs: add
	x (arabic thousands separator - 066C)


2) In the Standard, on page 275, Numeric Separators, a supplemental text like
the following might be added at the end of the paragraph:

___________________________

In latin usage for example, U+002C COMMA and U+002E FULL STOP may both take
the semantic of a decimal separator. The one that is not given this value is
then currently used as a thousands separator. Alternatively, space characters
or raised separators like U+0027 APOSTROPHE may act in this way. The latter is
current Arabic usage, where U+066C is a dedicated ARABIC THOUSANDS SEPARATOR,
while 066B is a special ARABIC DECIMAL SEPARATOR, even if 060C ARABIC COMMA is
used for the same purpose.

0598 HEBREW ACCENT ZARQA
05AE HEBREW ACCENT ZINOR
   
I cannot measure the impact of this old and welldocumented (UTN #27) problem,
and there are surely some good reasons to keep Formal Aliases minimal.
Personally I would prefer there were some here, so I don’t keep away from
making the following suggestion:

0598	HEBREW ACCENT ZARQA
	% HEBREW ACCENT TSINORIT
	* the Tsinorit is also used alternatively to place Zarqa or Tsinor above, following a printing preference
	* character name is a misnomer

05AE	HEBREW ACCENT ZINOR
	% HEBREW ACCENT TSINOR
	* this character is used to place Zarqa or Tsinor regularly above left


These FormalAliases would have three advantages:
 
— They are unique (U+05AE cannot be given the FormalAlias ZARQA because this
is already taken).

— They are homogenous (both are called following the usage in the book of
Psalms and the other poetic books).

— There is a strong coherence between names (the one is a diminutive of the
other) and practice (the one may be used alternatively instead of the other,
following a printing preference).

00DF LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S
1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S

While users are glad this letter has not been called a ligature (because it
isn’t), there is some reason to complain this letter has been called a sharp
s, because it isn’t neither (even if it was already called so in early
standards). The German sharp s does really exist as a phoneme, but it is
represented by a double s, not an ß. Worse, in Germany the original version of
the Standard is used, no translation, so native users do really complain. With
respect to font designers, Unicode has already well developed the glyph
comment. Now it would be nice to add the FormalAliases to these characters.

Furthermore, the comment “* uppercase is "SS"” should be avoided in this form
because it reminds an abbreviation that was used in Germany before and during
WWII.

There is also an on-going change that leads to prefer U+1E9E for uppercase.

The lines, as I suggest them, would therefore end up as follows:

00DF	LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S
	% LATIN SMALL LETTER SZ
	= Eszett
	* German
	* character name is an old misnomer
	* uppercase is two times U+0053, but tends to be 1E9E
[...]

1E9E	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S
	% LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SZ
	* character name results from a misnomer
	* lowercase is 00DF

And I would suppress in both cases the crossrefs “x (latin capital letter
sharp s - 1E9E)” and “x (latin small letter sharp s - 00DF)”, according to the
rule that in the Code Charts, special casing information is provided with
comments only.

The versioning of the alias names at U+00C6 and U+00E6 should correctly be
"(1.1)". This results from matching the NamesList-8.0.0d6.txt with
UnicodeData-8.0.0d8.txt. The NamesList shows:

00C6	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE
	= latin capital ligature ae (1.0)
00E6	LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
	= latin small ligature ae (1.0)

Therewhile, UnicodeData shows:

00C6;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE;Lu;0;L;;;;;N;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A E;;;00E6;
00E6;LATIN SMALL LETTER AE;Ll;0;L;;;;;N;LATIN SMALL LETTER A E;;00C6;;00C6

Field 11 in UnicodeData is the Unicode 1.0 name. For these instances, Unicode
is reported to have been forced by ISO to abandon the 1.0 names and to put ISO
names in their place, prior to issuing the 1.1 version of the Standard, that
is, the merged Unicode + ISO 10646 Standard. Therefore, the ALIAS_LINEs will
correct to the following:

00C6	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE
	= latin capital ligature ae (1.1)
00E6	LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
	= latin small ligature ae (1.1)

This particularly puzzling versioning might, perhaps, be explained in a
COMMENT_LINE:

	* this character has been renamed again in version 2.0

Whether such a comment should be added, or not, is another question. IMO it
may, to show Unicode has been willing to update names but is hindered to do
so. But as such a comment is most likely to wake up old acrimony, it finally
should rather not.

By contrast, surely it wouldn't make much sense to add a second alias, like:

00C6	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE
	= latin capital ligature ae (1.1)
	= latin capital letter a e (1.0)
00E6	LATIN SMALL LETTER AE
	= latin small ligature ae (1.1)

NamesList syntax

To complete my suggestion about adding a CODENAME_LINE, I suggest to choose 
the ampersand and to replace it by a lock. The complete syntax would then show 
as follows:

CODENAME_LINE:
		TAB "&amp;" SP NAME LF   
			// Replace &amp; by U+1F512, output line as code name

The lock symbol is consistent with the fact that an identifier name, once
published, must never be changed, and indicates clearly which name among the
two is immutable.

As a code character for the lock, I’d prefer the pound sign, but it isn’t a
part of the US Standard layout, only of the US International keyboard layout
and half of the latin Windows locale keyboard layouts.
 
U+00A3 POUND SIGN would be a reverence to the locale that determined code
names in the nineties. Similarly to the dollar sign as used in spreadsheet
software, it would signify stability due to locking of properties (no matter
how accurately they once were defined).

Nevertheless it might be inappropriate to associate a currency symbol.

By contrast, the ampersand is neutral and has a matching meaning. Another
advantage is that actually it occurs only three times in the NamesList, of
whom the third is an HTML code:

0022	QUOTATION MARK
	* preferred characters in English for paired quotation marks are 201C &amp; 201D
0027	APOSTROPHE
	* preferred characters in English for paired quotation marks are 2018 &amp; 2019
29DC	INCOMPLETE INFINITY
	= ISOtech entity &amp;iinfin;

There is no need for change, since the percent sign (marking up a
FORMALALIAS_LINE) equally occurs in other contexts in the NamesList.

About the principle of giving the true identifiers a place on the NAME_LINE,
lowering the stable but false identifiers, there is to say that many
implementations are so uncomplete there is scarcely any trace even of
FormalAliases to find. Among users, there is a preference for true character
names. Users who prefer stable identifiers, may consider to refer to the next
line in those cases.

This change brings that instead of a wrong Name and a true FormalAlias, there
will be a true Name and a wrong CodeName. This will resolve all the problems
brought up by uncomplete UCD parsers that are currently misused as UIs, or
that are designed as UIs but do not implement the complete range of UCD
datafiles.

To avoid globally wasting time and resources, the Unicode Standard must reach
the maximum of usefulness. As a Universal Character Set, it is designed for
use by end-users as well, not merely standardizers, implementers and
developers. Or at least, it _should_ be, as I’m pointing out.

This is why a small number of specialists who need names *stability*, stands
in front of a huge number of users who prioritize names *accurateness*. But
the latter don’t have means to rewrite or even adapt the Standard. As
experience tends to show, this is true for most developers, too, who rely on
the Standard and don’t aim at correcting it.

No matter what Unicode names are defined as, they are taken as designations,
as if they were scientific names. Scientists correct a name as soon as it
proves to be inaccurate. And scientists manage very well several names per
item while underscoring the most true one. This very useful system may give a
paradigm of the way Unicode could deal with character names. ISO and Unicode
having made a joint decision not to do so, it may be permitted to ask whether
that decision could have been right or wrong.

Take The Unicode Standard. In the text it uses current names, that are mostly
identical with the Unicode 1.0 names, while the identifier of many characters
differs from their current name. That may be called a useless and
counterprouctive complication, which may appear as an impoliteness to readers
who are not native speakers.

The issue after having done yet a big part of standardization, is to transform
a body-centered standard into a user-centered standard. A user-centered UCS is
directly useful without needing a lot of precautions. By contrast, the actual
concept is based upon the externalization of the care for accessibility, which
is time- and money-wasting outside.

However, this has no impact on my concern related to names supporting *all*

a Formal Alias where LEFT is replaced with OPENING or BACKWARD, and RIGHT with 
CLOSING or FORWARD, or following other patterns. (It may be noted that the 
names’ complication induced by these modifications is incomparably less 
cumbersome than the one that was due to the replacement of GUILLEMET with

For a *Universal* Character Set (as well as for an *International* Standards

U+0670 ARABIC LETTER SUPERSCRIPT ALEF needs a formal alias and 
a consistent subhead

All sources I could look up confirm that U+0670 is a vowel sign (and 
a combining mark). Since it is a misnomer, it needs a Formal alias, 
which I guess would be approximately “ARABIC VOWEL SIGN SUPERSCRIPT ALEF”. 
This results from the other vowel sign instances inside the block and 
elsewhere. 

This character is listed after a subhead “Point”. In the Syriac block U+0700, 
a “Syriac points” subhead is found indeed (U+0730), which is completed with 
the parenthesized “(vowels)” explanation. By contrast, in the 
Arabic block U+0600, most of the vowel signs are listed under 
“Other combining marks”, while the Arabic Extended-A block U+08A0 contains 
several “Extended vowel signs” subheads. 

Would it therefore be possible to rewrite the entry
@		Point
0670	ARABIC LETTER SUPERSCRIPT ALEF
	* actually a vowel sign, despite the name

in a way like this:

@		Point (vowel)
0670	ARABIC LETTER SUPERSCRIPT ALEF
	% ARABIC VOWEL SIGN SUPERSCRIPT ALEF
	* this diacritical mark is a vowel sign, character name is a misnomer

Or the existing comment is kept, but a formal alias seems to be unavoidable.

a FORMALALIAS_LINE, containing their Unicode 1.0 name SPACING CIRCUMFLEX, 
SPACING GRAVE, SPACING CEDILLA respectively.

This results from the usage as graphic characters (^, `) without any relation 
to their value as accents. This value is relevant only in their usage as 
deadkey characters.

Precision and unambigousness, a main issue in a standard of a UCS, turn out 
to be missing here. This is true as well for U+005F LOW LINE.  “Low line” is 
inconsistent with “overline”, it lacks the precision (spacing or combining) 
that is needed in a standard, and is globally less used than “underline” and 
far less than “underscore”.
Three sample instances could therefore show as follows. The first series is 
the actual state, the second is with additional aliases:

005E	CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT
	* this is a spacing character
[...]
005F	LOW LINE
	= spacing underscore (1.0)
	* this is a spacing character
[...]
0060	GRAVE ACCENT
	* this is a spacing character
[...]
__________________________

005E	CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT
	= spacing circumflex (1.0)
	* this is a spacing character
[...]
005F	LOW LINE
	= spacing underscore (1.0)
	* this is a spacing character
[...]
0060	GRAVE ACCENT
	= spacing grave (1.0)
	* this is a spacing character
[...]

However, actually the goal might have been to avoid showing too much how 
accurate the Unicode 1.0 names were. This may lead to suppress the 
versioning, while underscoring the importance of the aliases by raising them 
to FormalAlias state.
This would allow to remove the COMMENT_LINEs, because they become redundant, 
like this:

005E	CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT
	% SPACING CIRCUMFLEX
[...]
005F	LOW LINE
	% SPACING UNDERSCORE
[...]
0060	GRAVE ACCENT
	% SPACING GRAVE
[...]

The U+1D13A character name being a misleading misnomer, it can be allowed 
a formal alias taken from the aliases already provided, as for example 
“MUSICAL SYMBOL DOUBLE WHOLE-REST” (with or without hyphen?). 
Perhaps a “* character name is a misnomer” comment may be added too.

Although, “two” are already considered as “several”, therefore “multi” 
is not entirely wrong.

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: The Greek letter LAMBDA</p>

<pre>
Following H. G. Liddell and R. Scott, A Greek English Lexicon, 
the spelling LAMBDA is incorrect, and the real spelling of the related 
Greek letter is LABDA. By contrast, there is no mention of a spelling 
LAMDA. Nevertheless, the ISO/IEC 10646 chief redactor, who was 
a compatriot of H. G. Liddell and R. Scott, forced the Unicode Consortium 
to abandon the current spelling LAMBDA it had adopted, and to replace 
all instances with the non-existent spelling LAMDA.

I therefore suggest to create as many formal aliases as there are 
misspelled instances:

039B	GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA
	% GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMBDA
03BB	GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA
	% GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMBDA
1D27	GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL LAMDA
	% GREEK LETTER SMALL CAPITAL LAMBDA
1038D	UGARITIC LETTER LAMDA
	% UGARITIC LETTER LAMBDA
1D6B2	MATHEMATICAL BOLD CAPITAL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL BOLD CAPITAL LAMBDA
1D6CC	MATHEMATICAL BOLD SMALL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL BOLD SMALL LAMBDA
1D6EC	MATHEMATICAL ITALIC CAPITAL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL ITALIC CAPITAL LAMBDA
1D706	MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL ITALIC SMALL LAMBDA
1D726	MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC CAPITAL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC CAPITAL LAMBDA
1D740	MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC SMALL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC SMALL LAMBDA
1D760	MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD CAPITAL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD CAPITAL LAMBDA
1D77A	MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD SMALL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD SMALL LAMBDA
1D79A	MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD ITALIC CAPITAL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD ITALIC CAPITAL LAMBDA
1D7B4	MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD ITALIC SMALL LAMDA
	% MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF BOLD ITALIC SMALL LAMBDA

For personal use this is easily done in a spreadsheet. 
Nevertheless it is unefficient to do so if millions of developers 
and users must launch the process for themselves. Therefore, if 
Unicode could to the job once, that would be more economical.

Regarding the ISO, it has no right to purposely lower the 
cultural content of the Standard.

A Solution Combining Usefulness And Respectfulness Towards Stability Policy

Dear Unicode Technical Committee,

as we are tought by the principle which the ancient Romans forwarded to us: 

	Pacta tenenda sunt. 

This is why actual Formal Aliases must never become Character Names 
[as opposed to my opinion posted on Mon Apr 20 03:09:02 CDT 2015, and 
on Wed Apr 22 11:24:56 CDT 2015], regardless of the severity of 
the misleading users are victims of, and how crestfallen implementers 
and developers ever might be in front of a Standard making them waste 
time and money by asking to be translated to English.

This is why the draft of a solution Unicode has implemented 
since version 5.0, may be developed further. 
A Formal Alias is a kind of “second chance” for misnamed characters. 
Given that today’s computing resources allow to manage two names per item, 
there is no more need to keep Formal Aliases minimal. 

Furthermore, the NamesList syntax is not submitted to the Stability Policy, 
so Formal Aliases (including the "%" / U+203B "※" symbol) can be raised 
to the first line. The order “NAME_LINE, FORMALALIAS_LINE” is merely 
conventional and is not enforced programmatically. The challenge is 
to modify the syntax of the FORMALALIAS_LINE (adding CHAR), and 
to define an alternative syntax for the NAME_LINE (without CHAR).

The related NamesList syntax would then show as follows 
(I’m quoting the NamesList.html page, changes being highlighted 
with double asterisks):

CHAR_ENTRY**_N**:   NAME_LINE |  RESERVED_LINE
		| CHAR_ENTRY ALIAS_LINE
****
		| CHAR_ENTRY COMMENT_LINE
[...]

CHAR_ENTRY**_FA**:   **FORMALALIAS_LINE**
		**NAME_LINE**
		| CHAR_ENTRY ALIAS_LINE
****
		| CHAR_ENTRY COMMENT_LINE
[...]


The explanations which follow this syntax notation, would then probably 
be completed with a sentence like:

**A FORMALALIAS_LINE must be directly followed by a NAME_LINE.**

Then in the paragraph “Directly following either a NAME_LINE or 
a RESERVED_LINE”, the “FORMALALIAS_LINE” may be removed.

Fortunately, already today the NAME_LINE may occur elsewhere than 
in the first place, as it is stated: “The conventional order of elements 
in a char entry: NAME_LINE, FORMALALIAS_LINE, [...] is not enforced 
by the layout program”. 
The software issue would be that Unibook processes also the new forms 
of NAME_LINE and FORMALALIAS_LINE.


The related NamesList File Elements might then show this way 
(the first is a quotation):

NAME_LINE:	CHAR TAB NAME LF
			// The CHAR and the corresponding image are echoed, 
			// followed by the name as given in NAME

		**| TAB NAME LF
			// If the character has a formal alias**

FORMALALIAS_LINE:	**CHAR** TAB "%" SP NAME LF
			**// The CHAR and the corresponding image are echoed,**
			// followed by U+203B replacing %, 
			// then output NAME as formal alias


When these syntax changes are defined, this would be the first char entries 
having a formal alias today:

01A2	% LATIN CAPITAL LETTER GHA
	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER OI
01A3	% LATIN SMALL LETTER GHA
	LATIN SMALL LETTER OI
	* Pan-Turkic Latin alphabets

This proves that the name and the formal alias remain unchanged 
across these enhancements. Thus, stability stays guaranteed.


The great advantage of this array is, that software that does not care 
about formal aliases and nevertheless seems to be designed to inform 
end-users, will automatically show the true name if it parses the NamesList. 
The problem is with UnicodeData parsers, because they parse a file where 
no formal aliases are shown (which were added when the file format was 
already defined).

Therefore IMO it would be useful to add some fields in UnicodeData, 
one of which will contain the Formal Aliases (see also my post 
on Mon Apr 13 10:05:31 CDT 2015). 

In fact there are scarcely any backwards-compatibility problems with 
new fields, because out-of-date software is expected to simply ignore them. 

The missing visibility of Formal Aliases seems to be an effect of their 
not being in UnicodeData. Clearly, parsing supplemental data files to gather 
a complete overview of character information may be considered as unefficient. 

Consistently, many developers would expect Unicode adding as many fields 
to UnicodeData as needed to get at reach all data that are to be processed. 

Software that comes to bug under the effect of additional fields 
in UnicodeData, is likely to need a thorough overhaul in any case. 
As for that, it is simplier to implement additional fields than 
additional files.


For convenience, the list below is meant to illustrate how the NamesList 
and the Code Charts may look like, after applying the above and some 
previous suggestions. To shorten, FORMALALIAS_LINE and NAME_LINE are 
displayed only. Some ad-hoc annotation is added.
— Unfortunately this list is unfinished —

This character is not bidi-mirroring, like all symbols in the block, 
but this should IMO make an exception because in right-to-left script, 
the worshipping person is at back. Perhaps right-to-left scripts must use 
special fonts where all relevant symbols are mirrored. This is inconsistent 
with bidi-mirroring of mathematical symbols.

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: U+19B0 NEW TAI LUE VOWEL SIGN VOWEL SHORTENER</p>

<pre>
The first of the New Tai Lue vowel signs that are in beta review, U+19B0, 
is a vowel shortener. Unlike U+0EB1 LAO VOWEL SIGN MAI KAN, which a 
COMMENT_LINE points out to be a vowel shortener, 
U+19B0 NEW TAI LUE VOWEL SIGN VOWEL SHORTENER seems to have no proper name 
in New Tai Lue. Therefore, I would suggest to shorten its name to 
NEW TAI LUE VOWEL SHORTENER. (There are no other instances in Unicode where 
a ‘vowel shortener’ occurs, than these two.)

Actually:
19B0	NEW TAI LUE VOWEL SIGN VOWEL SHORTENER

Suggested:
19B0	NEW TAI LUE VOWEL SHORTENER

<pre>
Cross-reference not fully “accurate”

Dear Unicode Technical Committee,

would it be possible that the users of the Standard will be given 
xrefs showing the true character names, not merely internal identifiers? 
For example, at the new turned digit three U+218B, readers find 
“→ 0190 Ɛ latin capital letter open e”. But as I already posted, 
this so-called open e should be given a formal alias showing that its true name 
is latin epsilon. However, all these formal aliases, whether they are 
eighteen or one hundred and eighty, are of little use if these characters 
stay being called by their wrong name everywhere else.

To make it clear: Unicode won’t have a single wrong name in the Standard if 
in the early nineties, there were no people who made trouble and wrote out 
acrimonious words when the Unicode Consortium had removed the wrong name 
for Æ and æ to reset it to its (original) true value. You know the issue.

I newly got hope the ISO is not any more this tyrannic standards body it 
was apparently in the nineties, and that it would not longer insist upon 
that names stability which never created but trouble and acrimony among 
users, typographers, all the working force that is in contact with the 
documents published by Unicode, taking aim at using the characters.

Today, the Unicode caracter set is indispensable, and therefore Unicode 
can improve its usefulness at use (as opposed to the usefulness at 
standardization), whether by reengineering the names stability, or by 
hollowing it out with numerous prioritized formal aliases and smart 
cross-references which give the true name, eventually preceded by 
a percent sign, or not. Given that the NamesList syntax is out of reach 
of the Stability Policy, there are many possibilities.

People hardly understand that the Unicode Standard is maintained without 
sweeping out all the wrong names once for ever.

Marcel Schneider

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: Language conformance</p>

<pre>
The Charts must be written in British English, a fact that is reminded 
by the five (beta-review) Sutton SignWriting characters with CENTRE 
(U+1D862, U+1D863, U+1D864, U+1DA5F, U+1DA60), 
growing the total number to 30. 

Consequently, perhaps U+1F22D SQUARED CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E2D should have 
its alias “center field” converted to “centre field”, and the comments at 
U+205B “this is centered on the line, but extends beyond top and bottom 
of the line” and U+A8FA “zero-advance character centered on the point 
between two orthographic syllables” ought to be corrected too? 
(The aliases for U+2385, U+1F17B, U+1F17C are IMO purposely with “center”.)

As for a personal feedback I don’t know whether to complain or not. 
Practically, the American spelling has some advantages as it is more 
widespread, for example in style sheets, but also in current language, 
while “centre” may be regarded as French or as a historic spelling. 

At least one fact is certain: “CENTRE” was not Unicode’s choice.

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: Some comments on my feedback for PRI #297</p>

<pre>
Dear Unicode Technical Commettee,

I’m sorry to send you some more beta-related feedback *after* 
the deadline (the day after the deadline). It’s just a matter for me 
of not using the deadline as a pretext for not doing my job, even if 
finally the belated posts cannot be considered.

About this chronological order, Unicode could expect the beta review 
feedback would be prioritized, whereas I posted first my general concerns. 
This is because as a user I got convinced that the usefulness of the UCS 
must become centered on usage, while till now it is, in some essential 
settings, centered on standardization.

This is partly in the nature of a Standard. This part is now lesser 
because the UCS is well launched and there is no serious alternative 
any more. But partly it is a remainder of some personal external views 
in the beginnings. This part should not be taken into consideration 
because a UCS must meet a worldwide demand for true and reasonably 
widespread average identifiers (which in practice are used [not as 
descriptors but] as serious designations), and because it must be 
directly useful to end-users (who mostly read English), without relying 
only on the goodwill of overburdened implementers and developers when 
the challenge is to effectively correct misnomers and other useless and 
counterproductive complications and impolitenesses.

Now, as other Standards bodies outsourced the UCS and all management 
is centralized on the Unicode Consortium, the UCD data files and the 
UCS Code Charts can be boosted to reach at maximum reliability and 
ease of implementation.

Best wishes,

Marcel Schneider

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: Siddham section marks</p>

<pre>
The Siddham section marks U+115CA and U+115CB showing four tridents, 
a plural S might be added to the word TRIDENT in their names 
(for example SIDDHAM SECTION MARK WITH TRIDENT*S* AND DOTTED CRESCENTS), 
because the other constituents as RAYS and CIRCLES are plural too.

Another question is whether to add DOTTED in the character names. 
The dot terminating a crescent stack seems not to be distinctive, 
and its presence in the names is unconsistent 
(compare U+115CB - U+005CE with DOTTED, vs U+115D1 - U+115D4 without DOTTED). 
If shorter names are preferred, DOTTED may be removed from U+115CB - U+005CE; 
if fully descriptive names are aimed at, it can be added 
to U+115D1 - U+115D4 SIDDHAM SECTION MARK WITH *DOTTED* SEPTUPLE CRESCENTS.

In fact, as a dotted crescent looks like a Candrabindu, 
(DOTTED) CRESCENT(S) in these character names might become CANDRABINDU(S), 
if a huge majority of users would love this naming. 
The “U-shaped ornament” for its part, with the centerline inside, 
has a likeness with a trident without stick, a kind of echoed trident 
or just the trident’s prongs. This is striking because the tridents of 
U+115CA SIDDHAM SECTION MARK WITH TRIDENT AND U-SHAPED ORNAMENTS 
have U-shaped prongs, while those of 
U+115CB SIDDHAM SECTION MARK WITH TRIDENT AND DOTTED CRESCENTS 
have crescent-shaped ones.

As a result, these considerations might end up in some name change proposals 
(because the discussed characters are still in draft) as shown in the list 
below (not showing five section marks whose names I won’t suggest to modify), 
where the name after the code point is the original one, followed by one or 
several alternate names designed to meet different possible preferences.

Best regards,
Marcel Schneider

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: Code Charts: reserved code points</p>

<pre>
I’d remove the default glyph icon for &lt;reserved&gt; code points in 
the Code Chart lists because it may disturb the layout, overlapping 
some characters like U+115B5 SIDDHAM VOWEL SIGN VOCALIC RR. 
The hatched rounded square is nice but not indispensable for understanding. 
The syntax specifies “an icon for the reserved character” must be displayed, 
but if this ends up in hiding some parts of glyphs, 
the place might be left void.

As a detail, I would suggest to choose an upwards hatch rather than downwards 
in the Code Charts, despite of downwards (upper left - lower right) being 
heraldic usage.

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: Latin Extended-D and Latin Extended-E</p>

<pre>
In the COMMENT_LINE of U+A78F LATIN LETTER SINOLOGICAL DOT, 
the preposition ‘for’ occurs three times with two values. It may 
therefore be replaced with another preposition, as ‘in’ or ‘of’. 
Inspiring from the COMMENT_LINE of the preceding character 
(“used to transcribe Toda”), it would be also possible to verbalize 
the nouns, but the adjective would then convert to an adverb. 
Among the resulting options:

1	* used _in_ transliteration for Phags-Pa and phonetic transcription for Tangut
2	* used for transliteration _of_ Phags-Pa and phonetic transcription _of_ Tangut
3	* used _in_ transliteration _of_ Phags-Pa and phonetic transcription _of_ Tangut
4	* used _to transliterate_ Phags-Pa and _in_ phonetical transcription for Tangut
5	* used _to transliterate_ Phags-Pa and _for_ phonetical transcription _of_ Tangut
6	* used _to transliterate_ Phags-Pa and _in_ phonetical transcription _of_ Tangut
7	* used _to transliterate_ Phags-Pa and _phonetically transcribe_ Tangut

However, in the NamesList, another instance with matching context shows 
that the preferred form is with ‘in’ - ‘of’ (option 3 above):
0255	LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CURL
[...]	* used in transcription of Mandarin Chinese

In the COMMENT_LINE of U+A7B3 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER CHI, 
the space between “lower” and “case” should be deleted 
to conform to the usage in the NamesList / Code Charts.

In the NOTICE_LINE of the Historic letters for Sakha (Yakut) subhead (U+AB60), 
the final “that era” could IMO be replaced with “Sakha (Yakut)”, 
because “the [...] orthography of that era”, while literally correct, 
creates a redundance with the immediately preceding “from 1917 to 1927” 
and could therefore be used to repeat the language name rather than 
the fact that these letters are out of date, on condition that the result 
would be correct:

@+		These letters were used from 1917 to 1927 in the official IPA-based Latin orthography of _Sakha (Yakut)_.

By this occasion I wish to congratulate Unicode for having kept naming 
letters as U+AB62 LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN OE and 
U+AB63 LATIN SMALL LETTER UO, “letters” and not “ligatures” 
as would have done an early prescriptor 
(U+0153 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE; 
Unicode 1.0 name: LATIN SMALL LETTER O E).

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: Bidi-mirroring of symbols and pictographs</p>

<pre>
There are many symbols and pictographs which look better when mirrored, 
in right-to-left scripts, because they show living creatures or vehicles 
from the side. In this cases the front is generally directed to the 
opposite of the writing direction, in order that the reader encounters it 
at front. In left-to-right scripts, they are “looking” from right to left. 
Their looking direction is related to semantics. If they express a movement, 
for example U+1F32C WIND BLOWING FACE, they are “looking” in the writing 
direction (for example, in left-to-right scripts, from left to right).

All these symbols need to be bidi-mirrored as well as other symbols and 
characters, as I began to underscore in a post on Mon Apr 27, 2015 (yesterday). 
For a complete rendering engine, it will be enough to be flagged for 
bidi-mirroring, to automatically mirror the glyph provided by the font, 
and such a rendering engine can therefore display every symbol mirrored, 
even if the font does not provide mirrored glyphs. This makes sense for 
all symbol glyphs that do not contain (actually latin) text and 
whose semantics does not cover directionality (as pointing hands or arrows).

For an example, I’ve extracted a list (below) of some symbols from UnicodeData, 
belonging to the blocks U+1F300-1F5FF Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs, 
and U+1F680-1F6FF Transport and Map Symbols, and needing IMHO to be 
bidi-mirrored (in a bidirectional context).

Marcel Schneider

Dear Unicode Technical Committee,

in addition ‏to my beta feedback, and to complete, I’ve got some general 
concerns again.

About harmonizing the orthograph of “lowercase”, there is to say that while 
no instances of “upper case” (with a space) are found, there are beside 
of 77 instances of “lowercase”, six of “lower case”, among which three of 
the form “lower case is CHAR”. One having already been reported, 
U+2C7E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S WITH SWASH TAIL and 
U+2C7F LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z WITH SWASH TAIL remain to be corrected. 
Perhaps the other (U+2121 TELEPHONE SIGN, U+213B FACSIMILE SIGN, and 
U+1F670 SCRIPT LIGATURE ET ORNAMENT) should be too, for consistency.


A formal alias is IMHO missing for U+0F0A TIBETAN MARK BKA- SHOG YIG MGO, 
given that there is only the English translation of the right name, not 
the name itself in transcribed Tibetan, as it is given in the French 
translation “ListeDesNoms-7.0(2014-06-22).txt” (courtesy http://hapax.qc.ca), 
which shows as an alias “z'ou yik gui go”; if deleting the apostrophe for 
conformance to the English NamesList syntax rules, this would end up as 
	% TIBETAN MARK ZOU YIK GUI GO


A mathematical symbol, U+29A1 SPHERICAL ANGLE OPENING UP, has 
the ‘bidi-mirrored’ property but is symetrical (to a vertical axe). 
When mathematical symbols are symetrical (as U+29D3 BLACK BOWTIE), 
they ordinarily are *not* bidi-mirrored. Therefore I suppose that 
this property should be set to “No” for U+29A1 too.


A next step could be to update UTN #27, where several misnomers are 
still missing. Even if this Technical Note does not aim at giving a 
complete overview of *all* “Known Anomalies” (as results from interpreting 
words such as “provides information on many known anomalies” and “compiled 
information on many misnamed characters”), updating it would make it 
even more helpful.

The missing anomalies to mention are AFAK:

U+047C CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA WITH TITLO, 
U+047D CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH TITLO: 
The comment in the Code Chart “despite its name, this character does not 
have a titlo, nor is it composed of an omega plus a diacritic” qualifies 
these two characters for mention in UTN #27.

U+027F LATIN SMALL LETTER REVERSED R WITH FISHHOOK: 
There is just an alias followed by the parenthesized mention “(a misnomer)”. 
It therefore shoud be added on UTN #27 (and given a formal alias, see below).

U+0709 SYRIAC SUBLINEAR COLON SKEWED RIGHT: 
This misnomer has an existing formal alias, but neither is there a comment 
in the Code Chart stating “* (character) name is a misnomer”, as this 
occurs in a few character entries—with or without formal alias—, 
nor is it present in UTN #27.

The MICR (U+2446 sqq) have a mention at the end of the subheader notice: 
“The Unicode character names include several misnomers.” and should therefore 
be mentioned in the Technical Note (they were encoded 12 years ago).

U+309F HIRAGANA DIGRAPH YORI, U+30FF KATAKANA DIGRAPH KOTO: 
Andrew West states on “Unicode Character Names Part 1” that 
“These characters are ligatures of "db" and "qp" respectively,

U+122D4 CUNEIFORM SIGN SHIR TENU, 
U+122D5 CUNEIFORM SIGN SHIR OVER SHIR BUR OVER BUR: 
The formal aliases assigned to these two characters didn’t exist 
at the time of UTN #27, nor were the characters yet encoded.

That isn’t true for U+1D13A MUSICAL SYMBOL MULTI REST, but probably 
the weak issue dissuaded from admitting it to UTN #27.



There are several things to note about the fraction characters, 
beginning with U+00BC VULGAR FRACTION ONE QUARTER, 
U+00BD VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF, U+00BE VULGAR FRACTION THREE QUARTERS. 
First, the comment at U+00BC “other fraction characters: 2153-215E” must 
have its starting point changed to “2150” (it just hasn’t been updated 
when U+2050, U+2051 and U+2052 were encoded). Second, the recurrent comment 
“bar may be horizontal or slanted”, present in the Latin-1 block, should 
be echoed in some way for the other fraction characters. I suggest to add 
it as a first NOTICE_LINE in the “Fractions” subheader at U+2050:
@		Fractions
@+		Bar may be horizontal or slanted

This leads over to my third concern regarding fractions. 
AFAK the epithet “vulgar” applies to fractions with a slanted bar, 
as is the fraction slash (U+2044), whereas fractions with a horizontal bar 
are *not* vulgar ones. At least there is no reason to call them so, since 
this is current usage in mathematics. That “vulgar” epithet is, well, 
another mischief coming from that famous merger with the ISO/IEC 10646 draft. 
Since these character names are forwarded to end-users without being 
corrected, they must therefore be given formal aliases eliminating the 
wrong, misleading, useless and value-lowering precision:

At last, since my proposal list for supplemental formal aliases was 
uncomplete and presented other inconveniences, it would be permitted 
to attach another, more complete one below, which above all conforms 
to the actual syntax (NAME first). This and other changes were often 
done in an automatized (spreadsheet) way.

A leading principle was that whatever characters are bidi-mirroring, 
LEFT and RIGHT qualifiers *must* be avoided in their names, because 
they grow wrong when bidi-mirroring is effective, that is, 
in right-to-left scripts. Using LEFT or RIGHT in those names despite 
of their being mismatching in a part of the contexts, is missing 
respectfulness towards a part of the users. A UCS’s identifiers must not 
be unfitting for right-to-left scripts. It is to be underscored that 
Unicode aimed at making the character names universal, and it was 
under the influence of ISO that names grew wrong and worse. 
I’ve good reasons to believe that today, ISO would never approve 
the way things were done in the nineties.

There are however some bracketing characters that do *not* mirror, 
as U+FD3E ORNATE LEFT PARENTHESIS and U+FD3F ORNATE RIGHT PARENTHESIS, 
for legacy reasons. These characters may with some reason be called 
“left/right parenthesis”, and it is even helpful to do so.


About making an extensive use of Formal Aliases, there is to note that 
this is a condition for making Formal Aliases more attractive. 
The other condition is to make them a part of UnicodeDataExtended.txt, 
a new datafile with additional fields (given that UnicodeData.txt must 
remain stable with respect to software that cannot run when supplemental 
fields are present).

One issue that inhibits names updates is the outdating of UIs which use 
local copies, for example word processors and more precisely the charmap 
and special characters dialog. Editors fear puzzling users with name changes. 
These changes will stop puzzling under the effect of good communication. 
The move towards more truth in character names is even likely to deliver 
an excellent marketing argument, and the overall image of the brand will be 
strengthened. Software providers must endorse a cultural responsibility 
and avoid messing with linguistical legacy. If this job is done, the 
formal aliases I suggest, are already present in the UIs, and adding them 
to Unicode will simply consecrate this work. This will result in updating 
Unicode and re-establishing a reasonable synching between presumably current 
character names and UCD-based information sources. By contrast, if this work 
isn’t already done on developers’ side, the opportunity to do it has perhaps 
come. It can be performed thanks to a huge bulk of “new-old” Formal Aliases.

Experience seems to prove that for a UCS, the usefulness *at standardization* 
must be distinguished from the usefulness *at use*. I mean that a Standard 
useful at standardization is not necessarily useful at use. Reliability is 
a main criterium for usefulness at use, and this reliability is propped by 
character names’ accuracy, *not* stability delusion. Publishing a complicated 
Standard awaiting to be translated, even to English, is not to realize the 
potential of the process. Reality shows that people who do the job Unicode 
left undone, are too few and are likely to disappear, spending their time and 
working force for other productions.


Fundamentally, this change, how ever sweeping it might be, and regardless of 
the duration of former practice, is in conformance with Microsoft’s new 
Corporate Policy: 
	“[...] our industry does not respect tradition – it only respects 
	innovation. [...] I consider the job before us to be bolder and 
	more ambitious than anything we have ever done. [...] 	
	Our customers and society expect us to maximize the value of technology 
	while also preserving the values that are timeless.” 
Microsoft’s CEO Mr Satya Nadella wrote to All Employees on July 10, 2014 
(http://bit.ly/1wRIBqD). 

The job that might be on stage at Unicode now, would be to maximize 
the value of the Unicode documentation by making it directly useful 
to users, shortening the way from standardization to use by eliminating 
the step of translating to English and by making the Standard conform 
to the timeless cultural settings Unicode was respectful of in its 1.0 version.

In my post of Wed Mar 25 12:54:45 CDT 2015, the tenth code point 
should read U+1E37, not U+01E7.
Sorry.

The following list shows the real instances in the NamesList where 
what I call “idle ‘@+’” occur (that is, the instances of NOTICE_LINEs 
in char entries, which are there displayed the same as COMMENT_LINEs:

U+0140
U+0149
U+01A6
U+0268
U+0269
U+0277
U+027C
U+029E

U+1E5B
U+2301
U+234A
U+237B
U+237D

U+237F
U+2425
U+2426
U+16F27
U+16F32
U+16F52
U+16F53

Mostly that marks up information about backwards standards 
compatibility issues. These notices should be converted to 
ordinary comments (annotations) because without any 
distinctive formatting, it is of no use that they were 
notices rather than annotations.

Fundamentally, since those issues grow less important as 
the related standards are of no more than historical interest, 
they must not impact the Code Charts’ layout neither.

Best regards,
Marcel Schneider

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: About casing information</p>

<pre>
I’ve already sent some feedback containing comments on 
casing information provided in the Code Charts (Mon Apr 20, 2015). 
By applying I discovered that each case is different and leads 
to various solutions.

U+00D0/U+00F0, U+0110/U+0111: The legacy practice of encoding 
the capitals Ð/Đ once only was so confusing that these letters 
have largely merited being gratified with both casing annotations 
*and* cross-references with the other case.

The same applies to U+00FF/U+0178 for the reason that this capital 
had not been encoded at all, and that even in Latin-1 (that was 
not the only default, see the œŒ). In this case the annotations 
could rather explain why these two are so far away from each other 
(a fact that was bugging people).

By contrast, U+0110 and U+0111 are so near it doesn’t make much sense 
to provide xrefs however. Comments neither, if there were no debt 
to repair. But that should be done explicitly (even if without 
excuses, in a Code Chart...).

This is why I end up preferring it this way:

00D0	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER ETH
	* lowercase is 00F0
	x (latin small letter eth - 00F0)

00F0	LATIN SMALL LETTER ETH
	* uppercase is 00D0
	x (latin capital letter eth - 00D0)


0110	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH STROKE
	* lowercase is 0111
0111	LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH STROKE
	* uppercase is 0110


00FF	LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS
	* uppercase is 0178 (not encoded at 00DF for compatibility with ISO/IEC 8859-1)
	x (latin capital letter y with diaeresis - 0178)

0178	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS
	* lowercase has been encoded at 00FF for compatibility with ISO/IEC 8859-1
	x (latin small letter y with diaeresis - 00FF)


Regarding U+00DF and U+1E9E (my post of Mon Apr 20, 2015), there is a need of
resolving the puzzle of a dedicated capital letter while uppercase is written
with two S. Since ẞ (uppercase) is encoded and on keyboard, things grew simple
and the annotations are not accurate any longer. I would also add some
explanations for the capital letter (additions are bracketed with
underscores):

00DF	LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S
	= Eszett
	* German
	* uppercase is _'0053 0053' or 1E9E_
[...]

1E9E	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S
	_= latin capital letter sz_
	_* used to disambiguate the orthography of uppercase names_
	* lowercase is 00DF
	x (latin small letter sharp s - 00DF)

As already posted (Mon Apr 27, 2015), the spelling LAMBDA 
isn’t right neither, so giving the authentic spelling LABDA 
as an alias can help overriding the default of the ISO-originated 
Standardese. I suggest therefore adding an alias line yet for 
the capital U+309B, and echoing it for the small letter, 
by completing the existing one. To blur the issue even more, 
some other alternative spellings may be given, namely for 
the MU (MY), NU (NY), and UPSILON (YPSILON).

However, at merger, Unicode opposed some resistence against 
that messing with a Greek letter name (Unicode 1.0 was 
respectful of the canonical spelling LAMBDA, and even today 
there is U+019B LATIN SMALL LETTER LAMBDA WITH STROKE, 
= barred lambda, lambda bar, for Americanist phonetic usage), 
and it was supposedly not without hard discussions that 
Unicode finally resigned to comply. The exerted violence, 
on ISO side, presumably under the menace of secession, gives 
an idea of how important naming issues are for scaling domination. 
At the end at least, we hope, truth will overcome.

Best wishes,
Marcel Schneider

<pre>
As I’ve already posted on Mon Apr 27, 2015, the information about 
formal aliases seems to be out of reach for much software users who  
are confronted with when searching for information about characters. 
It therefore seems to be consistent to make it better available. 
The same would apply to informative aliases.

Unicode clearly states in NamesList.txt, that “this file should not 
be parsed for machine-readable information”. 
By the way, all the informative aliases Unicode added for 
the information of users, implementers and developers, are lost 
because they seem to be nowhere else in the UCD.

This is why I suggest launching a new comprehensive datafile 
following the model of UnicodeData.txt, generated by adding 
many fields to UnicodeData and called therefore 
“UnicodeData Extended” or UnicodeXData.txt (X like in XHTML), 
as I already began to suggest on Thu Apr 30 06:44:57 CDT 2015. 
Among the useful fields to be added, there will surely be 
one for the formal alias and 
8 others for the informative aliases, 
one for the Indic syllable category, 
one for the bidi-mirroring glyph, 
one for the version it was encoded in and 
one for the related date, 
16 for cross-references (code point only), 
several for standardized variants, and so on.

Launching this new file gives way to an extensive communication 
aimed at IT, and will surely create a buzz, which will be able 
to convince developers about the usefulness of aliases, 
whether formal or informative. Joint to the low-threshold access 
to them, that can help true names to come on stage. 
It is important Unicode makes this effort, because the actual 
high-threshold access to data, needing complex parsing algorithms 
and depending thus on the goodwill of the involved persons), 
is likely to hide the truth to the public.

I’m sorry to send you a late correction of a former 
(already belated) post of mine.

The formal alias suggestion I sent you on Thu Apr 30 06:44:57 CDT 2015 
for U+0285 LATIN SMALL LETTER SQUAT REVERSED ESH as a part of 
the list, is erroneous. The Code Chart states it must be 
LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG LEG TURNED IOTA WITH RETROFLEX HOOK. 
(UTN #27, which notes “This is actually a reversed fishhook r 
with retroflex hook.”, would thus be updated.)

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: Equalizing locales treatment in the Code Charts</p>

<pre>
While making up some files, I got aware of some need of feedback 
that unfortunately was not already covered accurately during 
the beta review period. Excuse me please to send you this 
a whole week too late.

Some formal aliases correcting misspellings in character names 
are completed by an annotation that supposedly plays the role 
of presenting an excuse to the public for having misspelled 
a character name. This feature is found in two character entries, 
namely:

FE18	PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRAKCET
	% PRESENTATION FORM FOR VERTICAL RIGHT WHITE LENTICULAR BRACKET
	* misspelling of "BRACKET" in character name is a known defect

1D0C5	BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL FHTORA SKLIRON CHROMA VASIS
	% BYZANTINE MUSICAL SYMBOL FTHORA SKLIRON CHROMA VASIS
	* misspelling of "FTHORA" in character name is a known defect

However, another character name has got the mischief of being 
misspelled, and has been added a formal alias to correct, but 
not the related annotation, while another misspelled character 
name (following UTN #27) remained without any addition:

0FD0	TIBETAN MARK BSKA- SHOG GI MGO RGYAN
	% TIBETAN MARK BKA- SHOG GI MGO RGYAN
	* used in Bhutan

0A01	GURMUKHI SIGN ADAK BINDI

(Regarding the Greek letter Lambda, already mentioned, 
the ISO spelling “Lamda” was intentional and is therefore 
not to be considered here as a misspelling.)

It seems consistent that these two characters would be given 
equally an annotation and, if not already done, a formal alias.

The same would then apply to every misnomer which is not already 
fully covered in the Standard. Proof of good quality, only two 
are remaining AFAK:

0709	SYRIAC SUBLINEAR COLON SKEWED RIGHT
	% SYRIAC SUBLINEAR COLON SKEWED LEFT
	* marks the end of a real or rhetorical question

0B83	TAMIL SIGN VISARGA
	= aytham

(Confusingly, the Tamil aytham has already an annotation 
but this says no word about the misnomer: “* just as for 
the Tamil pulli, the glyph for aytham may use either dots 
or rings”.)

Further about the Tibetan mark quoted above, there is to say 
that its counterpart is lacking a formal alias (reported 
on Thu Apr 30, 2015):

0F0A	TIBETAN MARK BKA- SHOG YIG MGO
	* petition honorific, used in Bhutan


Consequently, the discussed character entries might IMHO end up 
as listed below (additions bracketed with underscores). 
The more a character entry is tainted with defaults, 
the better it may be commented, as a kind of reparation.

Best regards,
Marcel Schneider

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: A new character property for symbols-and-pictographs support</p>

<pre>
To enhance the support of symbols and pictographs, and 
in extension of my post on Tue Apr 28, 2015, 
a supplemental character property might be added. 
It would express what I call the directionality dynamics, 
and could therefore be named Directionality Dynamics Property 
(shortened to “DirDyn-Prop” or the like).

This will allow implementers and developers to optimize 
programmatically the environment and the bidi-mirroring 
of symbols. For example, the sideways shown engines U+1F680.. 
may be bidi-mirrored or not, even in left-to-right script, 
depending on whether they shall face the reader in 
reading direction (as an expression of obligingness) or 
follow reading direction (as an expression of dynamics or, 
as used to see the ancient Greeks, of victory).

As it is shown in the Code Charts, this challenge has already 
been dealt with when the font designer choose to represent 
U+1F32C WIND BLOWING FACE as “looking” and blowing from left 
to right, making the left-to-right reader feel at ease by 
not facing him in reading direction, while the 
U+1F3A0 CAROUSEL HORSE is “looking” and turning from right to left, 
thus coming on towards left-to-right readers, a gesture that 
is fully consistent with its meaning as an invitation to visit 
the ‘amusement park’ (its alias-verified symbolics).

This relationship underscores the importance of fixing 
the directionality of symbols and pictographs, in order 
to facilitate the work of font designers and implementers 
by the means of previsible and customizable settings. 
As a result, an optimization of the pictographs’ expression 
would become easily performed at layout and publishing. 
Moreover, it will be clear once again that these symbols 
and pictographs *must* become bidi-mirrorable.

Marcel Schneider

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: A definition for Formal Alias?</p>

<pre>
I've got a problem with defining the concept of a Formal Alias.
But as I hurry up to send this belated feedback too, I fear to be 
even less clear.
IMHO the definition of what is a Formal Alias is inconsistent inside UCD.
In the NamesList, it is another name to name a misnamed character, 
marked up with an percent sign, output as reference mark U+203B in 
the Code Charts. This is the way it is referred to in the NamesList syntax
page and in the Stability Policy. In NameAliases.txt however, 
"The formal name aliases are divided into five types", and the above defined
ones are just a subset, labelled "correction" or, for U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK, 
"alternate".
So my idea is to unify the defines, probably following the pattern already
well-known thanks to the Code Charts, where the Control character aliases 
are not considered as formal aliases, and the Byte Order Mark is considered 
as having a formal alias name because its historical name Zero width no-break
space should become out of use (however, as even in recent systems, 
the U+2060 is not present, U+FEFF must stay in use as a ZWNBSP nevertheless).

Marcel Schneider

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: feedback on XML files</p>

<pre>

Dear Unicode Editorial Committee,

I’m sorry to have avoided opening the XML files (because I prefer 
text files and the Code Charts in PDF), and I wish to thank 
Unicode and related persons for having me made aware of. 
This allows me to update some previous feedback 
Mr Freytag has kindly reviewed, by trying to feed in 
a suggestion that would surely (I believe) enhance even more 
the access to data.

The informative aliases, which I mentioned 
on Sat May 2 07:10:09 CDT 2015, are unfortunately not comprised 
in the XML files of the UCD, but fortunately the 
&lt;name-alias/&gt; tag allows to add as many aliases as wished, 
for which I suggest to create an “information” type label. 
This powerful markup language allows even to add the annotations 
(COMMENT_LINEs) as they are provided to the readers of 
the Code Charts, when a &lt;comment/&gt; tag will be created. 
Even more, the comments may be given a type each one, 
like “languages”, “casing”, “compatibility” and so on, 
allowing to browse and display them by interests and with colors. 
The block headers, actually seeming not to be a part of 
the XML files neither, may be made available with appropriate tags 
by the way.

Further, there might be a way to underscore the importance of 
the formal aliases as denominations representing the greatest 
common denominator of the various community preferences by 
highlighting the most suitable name, as Mr Freytag projected 
to do for the Charts. This swing towards an immediate readability 
even of formerly misnamed entries should be mirrored in XML 
by moving the formal alias from a value of the ‘alias’ attribute 
of the &lt;name-alias&gt; tag towards a value of a future ‘fa’ attribute 
of the &lt;char&gt; tag, where we find already the NAME (‘na’) attribute 
and the 1.0 NAME (‘na1’).

Adding much more formal aliases, at least up to 337 
(please see below for another suggestion) may then be managed 
thanks to a new ‘correction-level’ attribute, which can take 
for example the value ‘mis’ when the deal is to correct 
a misspelling or another inadvertance (as are today’s 
formal aliases), ‘std’ when eliminating Standardese 
(CARON, LAMDA, VULGAR etc.), ‘bim’ for more respectfulness 
towards bidi-mirroring (the ‘open interval’ notation using 
*reversed* square brackets does not invalidate the principle), 
and so on. I still believe the discordance about *English* names 
may be resolved by opting for the most widely used locale, 
that is American English, because the nouns “slash” and “period” 
are used in all English speaking countries (but *not*, I agree, 
the spellings “labor” and “honor”, while “color” is widely used 
even in England because of its importance in style sheets and so on).


Another problem is about file format. 
Personally I would like a database in text format to paste into 
a spreadsheet, as can be the NamesList and UnicodeData (please 
refer to my e-mail to the UTC, which would better have been 
addressed to the Editorial Committee. I took notice of what 
has been said on the Mail List, notably about UIs, and wish 
to thank all persons who were so kind and discussed my e-mails. 
However, as much information is still missing in UIs, my proposal 
of what I already christened “UnicodeXData.txt” probably remains 
interesting because even corrected, the XML files will, I guess, 
not open in a spreadsheet like a plain text file does. 
So if it is permitted to post this wish, I would like to find 
*all* information that is code-point related, in a 
UnicodeData-shaped file for ready access.

More precisely, my suggestion is to add a field that will contain 
a complete names list representing the smallest common denominator 
of all user communities, to cater reasonably for the worldwide 
demand for a complete repertoire of *one* helpful *English* name 
per character. This field will therefore contain *all* useful 
formal aliases, whether they appear in the Code Charts, or not 
(that is, for the sake of graphics, layout and design issues). 
Further, it will contain the most commonly used alias for 
each control character. To finish, it will be completed with 
the identifiers as defined today, which are the default value 
of the field. That will allow getting readily an accurate name 
for *each* character.

For more usefulness, the next field should contain a type label 
like the ones defined in NameAliases.txt, or more consistently 
(please refer to my post of Tue May 5 05:10:30 CDT 2015):
N = NAME (default value): the normal character name, used also as 
	a technical identifier;
CT = CONTROL: the first listed designation (see NameAliases.txt) 
	of a control character;
FA = FORMAL_ALIAS: the designation of a (non-control) character 
	that is not identical with the identifier;
AFA = ADDITIONAL_FORMAL_ALIAS: eventually a kind of 
	“additional” formal alias name, which do not appear 
	in the Code Charts but are present in 
	the above mentioned field.

The next field will contain the abbreviation of 
the control character alias name, otherwise it will be empty. 
And as there are up to three names per control character (U+000A), 
the next four fields may contain these supplemental names and 
their abbreviations. 
(The three unnamed controls U+0080, U+0081, U+0099 may have 
their “figment” in the same field as the third name of U+000A.)

The complete range would look as follows, admitting that 
this will be the first thing to be added to UnicodeData.txt:
Field#	Content
15	Designation: Name|Alias|FormalAlias
16	Type: N|CT|FA|AFA
17	Abbreviation
18	Second Alias
19	Second Abbreviation
20	Third Alias
21	Third Abbreviation

Other fields may contain the informative aliases provided in 
the NamesList/CodeCharts and in the XML files, 
as now suggested above.


To complete my formal alias suggestions list sent 
on Thu Apr 30 06:44:57 CDT 2015, I’m pleased to follow 
Mr Wordingham’s advice of defining Formal Aliases for 
the Devanagari Dandas too, and I opted for the addition 
of “Punctuation”, which is already present with “DANDA” 
in two languages out of twelve, to enhance the relative 
universality of these two punctuations and as a mark 
of respect to compensate the trouble made till now 
to “Bengali/Tamil etc.” users:

0964	DEVANAGARI DANDA
	% INDIAN PUNCTUATION DANDA
0965	DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA
	% INDIAN PUNCTUATION DOUBLE DANDA

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: U+0964/5, U+00DF/1E9E; UCDXML; TUS</p>

<pre>
Dear Unicode Editorial Committee,

Sorry, my suggestion about formal aliases for Danda / double Danda 
should read of course...:
0964	DEVANAGARI DANDA
	% INDIC PUNCTUATION DANDA
0965	DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA
	% INDIC PUNCTUATION DOUBLE DANDA

There is further a point I got unfortunately not sooner aware of. 
It’s about uppercasing of the German ß. Looking at the properties 
of U+00DF in ucdxml.nounihan.flat.xml, I found that uc="0053 0053"
only. In the meantime, German usage begins to shift towards 1E9E, 
as I already reported and suggested updating the NamesList and 
Code Charts annotation for this character. IMO there should be 
an applications Settings checkbox: “☑ ẞ as uppercase for ß”.  
I don’t know if it’s already implemented. However, since U+1E9E 
is now a part of most current fonts and is on keyboard thanks 
to the new German standard layouts, defining uppercase as uc="1E9E" 
might seem appropriate to avoid loosing the ß in text files. 
If the custom setting requires uppercasing U+00DF to double U+0053, 
the cf="0073 0073" value can be used to perform that.

To understand the issue, it is necessary to remember that 
the uppercase latin letter SZ has been created and encoded 
on behalf of the German Standards body DIN to ensure that 
personal data are correctly stored and rendered. As in German, 
the ß is a distinctive part of orthography and is needed in names 
(if a person’s name is Straßer or STRAẞER, writing STRASSER or 
STRASZER is false because these are other names, equally borne),
not having an uppercase ß made much trouble and lead to some 
confusion. Today, fortunately this time is past, and 
the char props may be updated. All what is needed is already 
in the UCD except the new uppercase as a value of the uc property 
for U+00DF.

Therefore I suggest that Unicode takes advice from 
the German Standards body (DIN) whether to set 
this property to its new value. 


Now as unfortunately I’ve yet another feedback to send, I would 
suggest to complete the XML files with the xrefs too. While unlike 
suggested yesterday, the casing *annotations* may be avoided in XML 
(but *not* the one for U+00DF, nor the other ones like about 
languages, ancient Standards, font design issues, typographic 
preferences and much more), the XML format offers the opportunity 
of enhancing the cross-reference support. A new tag <xref/> might 
be given two properties: char="" whose value is the code point, 
and rel="" which is new and gives way to explicite the relationship 
between the character and the xref. This information is a real need, 
and its lack is actually very annoying. I can suggest already a few 
values as: 
"case" for casing-related xrefs;
"resemble" for characters resembling by their appearance;
"origin" when the cited character was really used to create the commented one;
"ornamental" if the matter is to suggest some nice alternate chars;
"usage" for characters with similar or opposite usage;
"family" to refer to other related characters (for example, for consistency of font design)
There will be surely much more.


I believe that more, easy-to-search and readily available information 
can notably enhance user experience, whether directly or by the 
means of better and richer implementations and user interfaces.


In that sense, I suggest also to create, if feasable, an online 
vesion of the Standard (I will say, the chapters of TUS which are 
actually available in PDF). Among the advantages on user side, 
one might quote the following: 
— better browsing and searchability of the whole text 
— better referencing when “Purple Numbers” are implemented
— easy to show-and-hide fine-levelled numbering
— interactive table of contents with quick access to items
— easy-to-quote text by simplier copy’n’paste  
— formatting settings to enhance accessibility
But that does not mean I would prefer an online version to the PDF.

To improve quotability, I would suggest to typeset the character 
names (which actually are in small caps) in uppercase throughout,
and to apply rather a reduced font size like specified in the style 
sheet of UAX #9 (where, however, redundant formatting leads to lowercase
and small-cap the uppercase source text at the same time (“span.name { 
text-transform: lowercase; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 75%; }”).
The result was not convincing as it appeared in UAX #9, section 3.2.

I’m still believing that there is a way to get a Standard for 
everyone’s use, the only condition being to read English. This allows
everybody to access, as I faultily spelled, the full bandwidth 
of the Unicode Standard in real time. “Real time” being in my sense 
the fact that no translation is needed in English, because 
the original version is fully understandable even for people 
who have just learned some English.

<b>Opt Subject:</b> PRI #297: Various corrigenda to my feedback</p>

<pre>
Dear Unicode Editorial Committee,

as I learned you will discuss some details after the UTC meeting, 
I hope this feedback which I shall send you as my last one 
(after several others meant to be the last), will reach you in time, 
because I found a few points to correct.


*** GRANTHA OM

The GRANTHA OM, U+11350, is named consistently with 
the DEVANAGARI OM U+0950, the GUJARATI OM U+0AD0, 
the TAMIL OM U+0BD0 and several other OM signs. 
Thus, my related feedback is out of purpose.


*** Character names in accordance with Bidi-mirroring support

The OPENING and CLOSING epithets for brackets are verified as 
accurate in all discussed contexts. A problem has been raised 
about the mathematical notation of an open interval: ]a, b[. 

I failed when Wed May 6, I supposed these were “reversed” brackets. 
IMAO the problem is resolved when considering the first bracket 
as closing the precedent interval, which extends 
from minus infinite to a, including a, and the second bracket, 
as opening the following interval, which completes 
from b (included) to +∞. 

This interpretation is highlighted when considering the notation 
of the two possible half-open intervals [a, b[ and ]a, b]: 
Every time, the bracket is CLOSING when closing an interval 
in numbering/reading direction, and OPENING when closing it 
in the other direction — a fact that BTW should lead to call 
[a, b[ “half-open upwards” instead of “half-open to the right”, 
when applying once again the *universalization strategy* that 
should be an _unremovable_ part of the framework when standardizing 
a Universal Character Set. As far as it applies to character names, 
this universalization strategy, after having been introduced 
by Unicode, has been removed by ISO.


*** Full stop

If PERIOD is not a suitable name for U+002E FULL STOP, 
one might consider giving it the frequently used DOT or POINT alias. 
However, in TUS, it is mostly referred to as a “period”, and 
this could IMHO be reason enough to prefer it, since 
unifying the way an object is called, makes the discourse 
better understandable. And that should be among the main goals 
of the Unicode Standard, rather than increasing the need of 
time-and-money-intensive translations, which probably brings 
a risk for many languages (except French) of remaining undone.


*** NamesList syntax and Code Charts layout

I’m sorry to have suggested (on Mon Apr 27 01:13:55 CDT 2015) 
to put the NamesList syntax upwards down by raising the “%” markup 
to the Names line when the char entry includes a Formal Alias, 
and I prefer recalling the other suggestion I sent 
on Mon Apr 20 03:09:02 CDT 2015: 
“Even simplier, the roles of CharacterName and FormalAlias 
may be inverted at these instances, giving the Formal Alias 
a Code Name status (and the Character Name a True Designation status).” 
I’m glad Mr Freytag agrees on the principle. 

Here like often I’ve not been clear: 
In the Unicode Charts, the name following the code point 
should always be a helpful one, an alias if necessary, 
and in that case, the old identifier can be given as is today 
the Formal Alias, with an annotation like 
“this alias is the (misspelled / mistaken / semantically obsolete / 
standardese, but) stable identifier”. 
That would replace part of the actual 
“character name is a misnomer”, 
“misspelling of [...] is a known defect” and 
“despite its name [...]” annotations.

For whole series of misnamed or ugly named characters as there are:
3021	HANGZHOU NUMERAL ONE  sqq,
00BC	VULGAR FRACTION ONE QUARTER  sqq,
2150	VULGAR FRACTION ONE SEVENTH  sqq,
010C	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CARON  sqq,
1D6B2	MATHEMATICAL BOLD CAPITAL LAMDA  sqq,
it could be sufficient to indicate the first former name 
(the identifier) of the series and explain in an annotation 
that the others must be extrapolated conformingly, 
in order to avoid overloading the listings in the Code Charts.


*** Font-size of figures in the Code Charts
(new subject)

By contrast with the figures of the code points in the Code point column, 
the figures of the code points in the next column are inconsistent in font size. 
Decimal digits are slightly smaller than hex letters. 
In most zoom factors this results in a difference of one or two pixels, 
but this may be notable even at 100 %.

This is likely to need a comment about the dislike of figures 
in today’s documents. Many things, including human language, 
are converted to figures (character encoding is one example).  
Meanwhile, a kind of what might be called a figure allergy 
seems to have set in, which leads to hide figures and digits 
wherever feasible (and is a part of the following concern).


*** Code-points in the Bookmarks side-pane

At the opposite of what I suggested on Wed Apr 1 09:43:56 CDT 2015 
about adding code points to the PDF bookmarks for display 
in the side pane, I understand today that would overload 
this reduced space and make the bookmarks less attractive. 
When language names and figures are put together, the result 
could lead to associations with a ranking, and raise idle questions 
like “Why has this language been encoded before that other one”.

There is however a need of browsing the Code Charts by code points, 
because code point searching tools are not always suitable. 
I suggest therefore adding a bookmark called “Code Point Ranges” 
at the end, which would not automatically expand. 
Once this bookmark expanded, there would be the list of blocks 
in another format with just range start and range end, 
matching exactly the blockhead list above as about the targets, 
but displayed apart, avoiding thus the problems related to figures. 
To complete, the blockheads should then probably be grouped together 
in a general bookmark like “Blocks”, which shall expand by default 
to produce the actual display. 

The advantage would be that rather than looking up the block by range 
in Blocks.txt and then searching the side pane for the blockhead, 
the Code Charts reader could search for the range in the side pane 
and get the Chart displayed by clicking the range’s bookmark.

This enhancement would need that the Portable Document format 
allows multiple bookmark sets. In other words, a given target 
could have several bookmarks in different areas of the bookmarks list.
Another requirement is that the bookmarks can be flagged to expand or 
not to expand by default. The expand-by-default behavior would be nice 
in TUS too, to prevent the side-pane from displaying only the chapter 
head bookmark even when the last settings were saved and the setting 
was to expand the current bookmark and/or to display the main bookmarks. 
This would be even more useful in an all-in-one PDF of the Standard 
(which I didn’t find yet) because the chapters’ list would display by 
default from opening on as a kind of “obligingness” towards the reader.

IMHO it is very helpful to look up characters in the Code Charts 
and to browse the Charts in PDF, especially the very ergonomical 
all-in-one. To compare glyphs in different blocks, several copies 
may be opened in as many instances of Adobe Reader.


Best regards,
Marcel Schneider

<pre>
Dear Unicode Editorial Committee,

Unfortunately the beta period is over, but not my feedback. 
I'm trying therefore to send this and another post with other 
subjects, for the case that notice can still be taken.

Sorry, my suggestion about formal aliases for Danda / double Danda 
should read of course...:
0964	DEVANAGARI DANDA
	% INDIC PUNCTUATION DANDA
0965	DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA
	% INDIC PUNCTUATION DOUBLE DANDA

There is further a point I got unfortunately not sooner aware of. 
It’s about uppercasing of the German ß. Looking at the properties 
of U+00DF in ucdxml.nounihan.flat.xml, I found that uc="0053 0053"
only. In the meantime, German usage begins to shift towards 1E9E, 
as I already reported and suggested updating the NamesList and 
Code Charts annotation for this character. IMO there should be 
an applications Settings checkbox: “☑ ẞ as uppercase of ß”.  
I don’t know if it’s already implemented. However, since U+1E9E 
is now a part of most current fonts and is on keyboard thanks 
to the new German standard layouts, defining uppercase as uc="1E9E" 
might seem appropriate to avoid loosing the ß in text files. 
If the custom setting requires uppercasing U+00DF to double U+0053, 
the cf="0073 0073" value can be used to perform that.

To understand the issue, it is necessary to remember that 
the uppercase latin letter SZ has been created and encoded 
on behalf of the German Standards body DIN to ensure that 
personal data are correctly rendered. As in German, the ß 
is a distinctive part of orthography and is needed in names 
(if a person’s name is Straßer or STRAẞER, writing STRASSER or 
STRASZER is false because these are other names, equally borne),
not having an uppercase ß made much trouble and lead to some 
confusion. Today, fortunately this time is past, and the char 
the char props may be updated. All what is needed is already 
in the UCD except the new uppercase as a value of the uc property 
for U+00DF.

Therefore I suggest that Unicode takes advice from 
the German Standards body (DIN) whether to set 
this property to its new value. 


Now as unfortunately I’ve yet another feedback to send, I would 
suggest to complete the XML files with the xrefs too. While unlike 
suggested yesterday, the casing *annotations* may be avoided in XML 
(but *not* the one for U+00DF, nor the other ones like about 
languages, old Standards, font design issues, typographic 
preferences and much more), the XML format offers the opportunity 
of enhancing the cross-reference support. A new tag &lt;xref/&gt; might 
be given two properties: char="" whose value is the code point, 
and rel="" which is new and gives way to explicite the relationship 
between the character and the xref. This information is a real need, 
and its lack is actually very annoying. I can suggest already a few 
values as: 
"case" for casing-related xrefs;
"resemble" for characters resembling by their appearance;
"origin" when the cited character was used to create the commented one;
"ornamental" if the matter is to suggest some nice alternate chars;
"usage" for characters with similar or opposite usage;
"family" to refer to other related characters (for example, for consistency of font design)

I believe that more, easy-to-search and readily available information 
can notably enhance user experience, whether directly or by the 
means of better and richer implementations and user interfaces.

— better referencing when “Purple Numbers” are implemented
— easy to show-and-hide fine-levelled numbering
— interactive table of contents with quick access to items

— formatting settings to enhance accessibility
But that does not mean I would prefer an online version to the PDF.

To improve quotability, I would suggest to typeset the character

and to apply rather a reduced font size like specified in the style

and small-cap the uppercase source text at the same time (“span.name { 
text-transform: lowercase; font-variant: small-caps; font-size: 75%; }”).
The result was not convincing as it appeared in UAX #9, section 3.2.

I’m still believing that there is a way to get a Standard for 
everyone’s use, the only condition being to read English. This allows
everybody to access (as I misspelled on the Mail List) the full bandwidth 
of the Unicode information in real time. Real time is here in my sense 
the fact that the original documentation is directly usable for almost 
everybody.

accurate in all discussed contexts. A problem has been raised 
about the mathematical notation of an open interval: ]a, b[. 

I failed when Wed May 6, I supposed these were “reversed” brackets. 
IMAO the problem is resolved when considering the first bracket 
as closing the precedent interval, which extends 
from minus infinite to a, including a, and the second bracket, 
as opening the following interval, which completes 
from b (included) to +∞. 

This interpretation is highlighted when considering the notation 
of the two possible half-open intervals [a, b[ and ]a, b]: 
Every time, the bracket is CLOSING when closing an interval 
in numbering/reading direction, and OPENING when closing it 
in the other direction — a fact that BTW should lead to call 
[a, b[ “half-open upwards” instead of “half-open to the right”, 
when applying once again the *universalization strategy* that 
should be an _unremovable_ part of the framework when standardizing 
a Universal Character Set. As far as it applies to character names, 
this universalization strategy, after having been introduced 
by Unicode, has been removed by ISO.


*** Full stop

If PERIOD is not a suitable name for U+002E FULL STOP, 
one might consider giving it the frequently used DOT or POINT alias. 
However, in TUS, it is mostly referred to as a “period”, and 
this could IMHO be reason enough to prefer it, since 
unifying the way an object is called, makes the discourse 
better understandable. And that should be among the main goals 
of the Unicode Standard, rather than increasing the need of 
time-and-money-intensive translations, which probably brings 
a risk for many languages (except French) of remaining undone.


*** NamesList syntax and Code Charts layout

I’m sorry to have suggested (on Mon Apr 27 01:13:55 CDT 2015) 
to put the NamesList syntax upwards down by raising the “%” markup 
to the Names line when the char entry includes a Formal Alias, 
and I prefer recalling the other suggestion I sent 
on Mon Apr 20 03:09:02 CDT 2015: 
“Even simplier, the roles of CharacterName and FormalAlias 
may be inverted at these instances, giving the Formal Alias 
a Code Name status (and the Character Name a True Designation status).” 
I’m glad Mr Freytag agrees on the principle. 

Here like often I’ve not been clear: 
In the Unicode Charts, the name following the code point 
should always be a helpful one, an alias if necessary, 
and in that case, the old identifier can be given as is today 
the Formal Alias, with an annotation like 
“this alias is the (misspelled / mistaken / semantically obsolete / 
standardese, but) stable identifier”. 
That would replace part of the actual 
“character name is a misnomer”, 
“misspelling of [...] is a known defect” and 
“despite its name [...]” annotations.

For whole series of misnamed or ugly named characters as there are:
3021	HANGZHOU NUMERAL ONE  sqq,
00BC	VULGAR FRACTION ONE QUARTER  sqq,
2150	VULGAR FRACTION ONE SEVENTH  sqq,
010C	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CARON  sqq,
1D6B2	MATHEMATICAL BOLD CAPITAL LAMDA  sqq,
it could be sufficient to indicate the first former name 
(the identifier) of the series and explain in an annotation 
that the others must be extrapolated conformingly, 
in order to avoid overloading the listings in the Code Charts.


*** Font-size of figures in the Code Charts
(new subject)

By contrast with the figures of the code points in the Code point column, 
the figures of the code points in the next column are inconsistent in font size. 
Decimal digits are slightly smaller than hex letters. 
In most zoom factors this results in a difference of one or two pixels, 
but this may be notable even at 100 %.

This is likely to need a comment about the dislike of figures 
in today’s documents. Many things, including human language, 
are converted to figures (character encoding is one example).  
Meanwhile, a kind of what might be called a figure allergy 
seems to have set in, which leads to hide figures and digits 
wherever feasible (and is a part of the following concern).


*** Code-points in the Bookmarks side-pane

At the opposite of what I suggested on Wed Apr 1 09:43:56 CDT 2015 
about adding code points to the PDF bookmarks for display 
in the side pane, I understand today that would overload 
this reduced space and make the bookmarks less attractive. 
When language names and figures are put together, the result 
could lead to associations with a ranking, and raise idle questions 
like “Why has this language been encoded before that other one”.

There is however a need of browsing the Code Charts by code points, 
because code point searching tools are not always suitable. 
I suggest therefore adding a bookmark called “Code Point Ranges” 
at the end, which would not automatically expand. 
Once this bookmark expanded, there would be the list of blocks 
in another format with just range start and range end, 
matching exactly the blockhead list above as about the targets, 
but displayed apart, avoiding thus the problems related to figures. 
To complete, the blockheads should then probably be grouped together 
in a general bookmark like “Blocks”, which shall expand by default 
to produce the actual display. 

The advantage would be that rather than looking up the block by range 
in Blocks.txt and then searching the side pane for the blockhead, 
the Code Charts reader could search for the range in the side pane 
and get the Chart displayed by clicking the range’s bookmark.

This enhancement would need that the Portable Document format 
allows multiple bookmark sets. In other words, a given target 
could have several bookmarks in different areas of the bookmarks list.
Another requirement is that the bookmarks can be flagged to expand or 
not to expand by default. The expand-by-default behavior would be nice 
in TUS too, to prevent the side-pane from displaying only the chapter 
head bookmark even when the last settings were saved and the setting 
was to expand the current bookmark and/or to display the main bookmarks. 
This would be even more useful in an all-in-one PDF of the Standard 
(which I didn’t find yet) because the chapters’ list would display by 
default from opening on as a kind of “obligingness” towards the reader.

IMHO it is very helpful to look up characters in the Code Charts 
and to browse the Charts in PDF, especially the very ergonomical 
all-in-one. To compare glyphs in different blocks, several copies 
may be opened in as many instances of Adobe Reader.


Best regards,
Marcel Schneider

Feedback on "idle" @+ notices.

The nameslist is not intended for machine processing, other than by the code
chart layout tool. In that context the use of @+ is motivated and not idle.


Proposed resolution of feedback: not accepted.

Feedback on bookmarks

There are other tools for searching characters by code point value.


Proposed resolution of feedback: not accepted

---

Feedback on numbering levels in the standard

While fewer levels make for a more attractive book design, the difficulties in
citing material in the standard are real.


Proposed resolution of feedback: forward to ed committee

Feedback on showing mirrored glyphs

There are cases where the mirrored forms are not perfect mirror images (cube
root 221B, for example, where the "3" does not mirror). In such cases, the
mirrored shape might perhaps be documented as "alternate glyph". In cases of
unusual mirroring behavior an annotation like that for FD3E and FD3F should be
sufficient. One might consider adding a note on mirroring behavior at the
block level for arrows and mathematical symbols, pointing out that arrows are
not mirrored.


Proposed resolution of feedback: forward to ed committee

Feedback on extended datafile

The purpose of that is served by the XML version of the UCD.


Proposed resolution of feedback: not accepted

Feedback on character naming policy and stability (various)

There is little to be gained by abandoning the existing interpretation of
character names as identifiers or to abandon the corresponding stability
policy. The negatives on the other hand are huge.


Proposed resolution of feedback: not acceptable

---

Feedback on details of text in the standard and annotations to the nameslist (various)

These are too detailed to review in the full UTC, but some appear useful.

Feedback on CODENAME (mentioned in two sections)

In general, adding more syntax to the nameslist would make it unnecessarily
complex. However, it might be useful to invert the display of name aliases,
esp. where the original name is a misnomer or typo. I other words, the ed comm
might look into whether it's feasible to show the most suitable "alias" in the
formal "NAME" line of the code charts (and the original name as annotation
using the syntax for alias). For the nameslist, tracking which is which is
perhaps less important than to de-emphasize mistakes.

Rather than moving the % annotation (which would break some deeply embedded
assumptions in the code for the layout processor) the idea would be to
redefine what the contents of the nameslist are. The % annotation would then
no longer indicate "the" formal alias for a character name, but treat both
names and alias as "aliases" throughout, with the first listed one becoming
the "preferred" alias (instead of, as before, the UnicodeData "name"). This
would be most useful in cases of actual "corrections".

It's at least useful enough to have the ed committee have a look at this.

For people needing to track which alias has what status (original, vs. formal
alias) the data files give that answer.

Proposed resolution of feedback: forward to ed committee

---

Feedback on using aliases to "improve" character names (various)

This is ultimately a losing proposition. Many characters are used in multiple
ways, or have diverse names in different user communities. Attempting to
improve even those names where a consensus alternative could be found would
only result in raising the expectations on character names and make the
intractable cases stand out even more.

Even OPENING and CLOSING cannot be assigned uniquely (cf. mathematical use like]a,b[ ).
